			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6">As indicated by the blocks of codes in Chapter 14, ICD-10-CM contains codes for the urinary system, male and female reproductive systems, disorders of the breast, and complications occurring in the intraoperative and postoperative periods. When ICD-10-CM was developed, the terminology for genitourinary conditions was updated to reflect current medical practice. Specificity was added to the code descriptions including the identification of the patient’s gender to correctly code posttraumatic urethral stricture.</p>
			<p class="Text">Genitourinary disorders in diseases classified elsewhere have been placed in their own category at the end of each block of Chapter 14. For example, one category, N08, Glomerular disorders in diseases classified elsewhere, is used to identify glomerulonephritis, nephritis, and nephropathy in diseases classified elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="Text">Advances in medical treatment prompt changes in Chapter 14.

			<p class="_-hd">Recurrent and Persistent Hematuria (N02)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hematuria</span> is the presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. Hematuria can be a symptom of an undiagnosed disease, or hematuria can be present with another condition in the genitourinary tract. If the cause of hematuria has not been identified, symptom codes are used. For example, <span class="CharOverride-1">gross hematuria</span> (R31.0) is the presence of blood in the urine in sufficient quantity to be visible to the naked eye. <span class="CharOverride-1">Microscopic hematuria</span> (R31.1, R31.21–R31.29) is the presence of blood cells in the urine visible only under the microscope. The code R31.9 is&#160;used if only the symptom of hematuria is documented (Dorland 2012, 843).</p>
			<p class="Text">Hematuria can be caused by a number of underlying urinary conditions, including urinary tract infections, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and kidney and ureteral calculi. In patients with certain risk factors, hematuria is a cardinal sign of bladder cancer. These patients require more intensive workup than do the primary hematuria patients. Patients presenting with hematuria who are at high risk for bladder cancer have other distinct risk factors: currently smoking or history of tobacco use, voiding dysfunction, personal history of urinary tract infections, and personal history of irradiation. Bladder cancer is generally associated with environmental or occupational factors and less often familial or inherited.</p>
			<p class="Text">If the physician describes the patient’s hematuria as recurrent, persistent, or idiopathic, the condition is classified to Chapter 14 category code N02, Recurrent and persistent hematuria. The subcategories of N02 identify whether glomerular lesions, glomerulonephritis, or other morphological changes are present in the kidney.</p>

			<p class="Text">Care of patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 is intensive and complicated. For any patient, the goal is to slow the progression of CKD or better prepare the patient for renal replacement therapy. The GFR is a laboratory test to measure kidney function. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli of the kidney each minute. Glomeruli are the filters in the kidneys that eliminate waste from the blood (Martin 2021). According to the National Kidney Foundation, the GFR is the best test to measure the patient’s level of kidney function and determine the patient’s stage of kidney disease. The physician calculates the GFR based on the results of the patient’s blood creatinine test, patient’s age, body size, and gender. If the GFR number is low, the kidneys are not functioning well as they should. As the kidney disease gets worse, the GFR number goes down. By measuring the GFR along with other clinical factors, the physician can better detect kidney disease early in its progress and take measures at slowing the kidney’s loss of function (NKF 2023b).</p>
			<p class="Text">Chronic renal insufficiency is a form of CKD classified with code N18.9, Chronic kidney disease, unspecified. Also included in this unspecified code are the diagnoses of chronic renal disease and chronic renal failure. A specific form of CKD and chronic renal insufficiency should not be coded in the same record. Renal insufficiency or acute renal insufficiency, a vague but different condition from CKD, is classified to code N28.9, Disorder of kidney and ureter, unspecified, with other nonspecific descriptions such as acute renal disease or renal disease unspecified. These forms of chronic kidney disease develop gradually in the patient over time, often associated with hypertension or diabetes. The condition may be controlled but generally is irreversible.</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Acute kidney failure,</span> or acute renal failure, is also described as <span class="CharOverride-1">nontraumatic acute kidney injury (AKI)</span>. Symptoms include oliguria or anuria with hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema. AKI is a syndrome that results in a sudden decrease in kidney function or kidney damage in a short period of time. AKI causes waste products to collect in the blood making it difficult for the kidneys to keep a balance of fluids in the body. The build-up of fluids affects the heart, lungs, brain, and other organs from functioning properly. AKI can lead to chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and death. Even a mild episode of AKI can have long-lasting effects on the patient’s health. Physicians may identify acute kidney failure with more specificity by referring to it as prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal, which more specifically identifies underlying causes such as congestive heart failure (prerenal), acute nephritis or nephrotoxicity (intrarenal), or obstruction of urine flow out of the kidneys (postrenal). Acute kidney failure typically develops over a short period of time as part of another illness and is generally reversible; it is corrected as the underlying disease is treated or controlled. Major causes of AKI include decreased blood flow to the kidneys from hypotension, blood or fluid loss, heart attack, heart failure, use of certain drugs, severe allergic reactions, burns, injuries, and major surgery. Other causes are kidney disease, such as acute glomerulonephritis, tubular necrosis, sepsis, and blockage in the urinary tract, such as an enlarged prostate, kidney stones, and blood clots in the urinary tract. Acute <span id="page473" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 473"></span>kidney failure or acute renal failure is assigned to category N17, with the fourth character identifying the type of necrosis present (NKF 2023a).</p>

Most cases are due to a vaginal infection that extends through the urethra to the bladder. Cystitis in men is due to urethral or prostatic infections or catheterizations. Symptoms include burning or painful urination, urinary urgency and frequency, nocturia, suprapubic pain, and lower back pain. A cross-section diagram of the bladder is shown in figure 17.3.</p>

			<span id="page474" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 474"></span>
			<p class="Text">A diagnosis of cystitis is made by obtaining a urine specimen from the bladder by either catheterization or a clean-catch midstream sample. A bacterial colony count of greater than 1,000 colonies/mL in a catheterized specimen indicates cystitis, as does a bacterial count of greater than 100,000/mL in a midstream sample. Urine also may be positive for pyuria and hematuria. Therapy with antibiotics is prescribed for uncomplicated infections. The coder should not arbitrarily record an additional diagnosis on the basis of an abnormal laboratory finding alone, for example, bacteria present in a urine culture. If the specific diagnosis is not clearly stated in the health record, the physician should always be queried.</p>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM classifies cystitis to category N30, with the fourth-character subcategories describing type, severity, and location. The codes also identify whether or not hematuria is present with cystitis. An instruction at the beginning of this category advises that an additional code is used to identify the infectious agent (B95–B97). The options for coding cystitis in ICD-10-CM are as follows:</p>

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-31">Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (N40)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The diagnosis of <span class="CharOverride-1">benign prostatic hypertrophy</span> may also be stated as <span class="CharOverride-1">enlarged prostate</span>, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or nodular prostate. The terminology of BPH may be found in health records in place of the diagnosis of enlarged prostate, but the two descriptions are synonymous. It is a condition commonly occurring in men by the age of 60 years, as part of the normal aging process. By age 80, about 80 percent of men have an enlarged prostate gland. However, only about half of these men have any symptoms due to their enlarged prostate (NKF 2015). The prostate gland, which encircles the urethra at the base of the bladder, becomes enlarged and presses on the urethra, obstructing the flow of urine from the bladder and causing difficulty urinating. This may also be described as <span class="CharOverride-1">benign bladder neck obstruction (BNO)</span>. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate may be referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)</span> and include incomplete bladder emptying, nocturia, straining on <span id="page475" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 475"></span>urination, urinating more often or frequency, having to get up at night to urinate or nocturia, unable to start urinating or hesitancy, incontinence, obstruction, retention, urgency, or weak urinary stream. Straining to void may rupture veins of the prostate, causing hematuria. The ICD-10-CM codes distinguish between benign prostatic hyperplasia or nodular prostate with and without lower urinary tract symptoms.</p>
			<p class="Text">A diagnosis of a benign prostatic hyperplasia or an enlarged prostate is made by a rectal examination that finds the prostate enlarged and with a rubbery texture. Urinalysis shows WBC, RBC, albumin, bacteria, and blood. Cystoscopy reveals the extent of enlargement. A postvoiding cystogram shows the amount of residual urine in the bladder, and the physician can decide how much the prostate is blocking the urine stream. Treatments for a benign prostatic hyperplasia include medications such as alpha-blockers to relax the muscle tissue in the prostate to relieve the blockage or testosterone that can shrink the prostate when the symptoms are severe enough to be troubling to the patient or if the function of the urinary tract is affected or if there are complications such as bleeding, kidney infections, or kidney damage. Surgery removes some of the enlarged prostate tissue to relieve the symptoms. Other treatments use electric current or thermal therapy to reduce the prostate gland’s size (NKF 2015).</p>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM classifies benign prostatic hyperplasia or nodular prostate to category N40. Some forms of the disease may be indicative of the need for further testing due to the increased risk for prostatic cancer. The enlargement of the prostate often produces the symptom of urinary obstruction or the inability to urinate. The urinary obstruction is the problem that typically brings the patient to the physician or to the hospital emergency department.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Menopause</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The diagnosis given by a healthcare provider of <span class="CharOverride-1">menopause</span> or menopausal syndrome often needs to be more specific. Menopause is defined as occurring 12 months after the last menstrual period in the woman and marks the end of menstrual cycles. Menopause can happen when a woman is in her 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States. Menopause is a natural biological process (Mayo Clinic 2023). ICD-10-CM includes several options for coding. Codes exist for both symptomatic menopausal syndrome and asymptomatic menopausal status. The symptoms a woman may experience with menopause are hot flashes or flushing, sleeplessness, night sweats, headache, and a lack of concentration, and in some women, there are mood changes such as anxiety or feelings of sadness and loss (Mayo Clinic 2023). Subcategory code N95.1, Menopausal and female climacteric states, includes a “use additional code for associated symptoms” note to direct the coder to assign other codes to describe the menopausal symptoms the woman is experiencing.</p>
			<p class="Text">Menopause occurs either as the result of the natural aging process or as an artificially induced menopause after a hysterectomy when the uterus and ovaries are removed or after other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There is no treatment for menopause except to relieve the signs and symptoms, for example, with hormone therapy to reduce hot flashes, with vaginal estrogen to reduce vaginal dryness, low-dose antidepressants when needed, and medications to prevent or treat osteoporosis that is known to occur in postmenopausal women (Mayo Clinic 2023). For coding, it is necessary to know if the patient has asymptomatic, premature due to surgery or radiation, or symptomatic menopause as different codes are available. The fact that the woman is experiencing symptoms because of the menopausal process or is asymptomatic is required to code the status correctly.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLES:</span>&#9;The patient who has a menopausal disorder or symptoms associated with artificial or postsurgical menopause may be coded with the following:</p>

The approach for these procedures is frequently endoscopic through a natural orifice, such as the vagina and urethra, as well as percutaneous (for example, laparoscopic). Robotic-assisted prostatic and uterine procedures are becoming more common. An additional code is used to designate that the procedure was robotic assisted. The Index entry for robotic-assisted procedure directs the coder to Table 8E0 in ICD-10-PCS.

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-44">Hemodialysis and Renal Replacement Therapy</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Hemodialysis and renal replacement therapy may be performed for patients with conditions that produce renal failure that may be coded from this chapter. The amount of time the dialysis is performed is not the important factor for coding purposes. The type of dialysis is what should be coded. Intermittent hemodialysis is the conventional treatment usually performed for ESRD, three times a week, for less than six hours per session. Two other forms of hemodialysis<span id="page487" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 487"></span> are referred to as renal replacement therapy (RRT). These are performed on patients with acute kidney injury or acute renal failure and delivered to critically ill patients.  Prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT), also called SLED (sustained low efficiency dialysis) or EDD (extended daily dialysis), is performed for 6–18 hours per day and is a gentler form of dialysis on very ill patients. The second type is continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), also called CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) or CCVHD (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) or CVVHDF (continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration), and is performed for at least 18 hours a day and is the slowest and gentlest hemodialysis for patients who have acute kidney injury that has resulted in hemodynamic instability. They would not be able to tolerate the other forms of dialysis. The hemodialysis and renal replacement therapy codes are included in the Extracorporeal or Systemic Assistance and Performance tables for the Urinary body system with the 5th character identifying the duration or type of filtration, that is dialysis or renal replacement therapy:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-27">5A1D70Z for intermittent hemodialysis</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-28">5A1D80Z for prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">5A1D90Z for continuous renal replacement therapy</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-41">Generally, the hospital can decide how often to code the procedures on a hospitalized patient. Usually, the practice is to code the intermittent hemodialysis one time for each patient receiving it, no matter how many days it is done. The practice may be coded one time per admission for each type of dialysis or renal replacement therapy instead of coding when it is performed, for example, every day during a hospital stay.</p>
