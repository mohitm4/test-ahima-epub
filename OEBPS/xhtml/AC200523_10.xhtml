			<p class="Text">The structure of the codes for diseases of the eye and adnexa is by site. The terminology for some of the categories in Chapter 7 has been updated to reflect current terminology. For example, senile cataract terminology has been updated to age-related cataract. There has been an expansion of the number of characters in the codes for eye and adnexa diseases to describe right side, left side, and in some cases bilateral conditions. There is also a code for “unspecified” side to use when the health record documentation does not specify the laterality of the condition.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes <br />for ICD-10-CM Chapter 7, Diseases of the <br />Eye and Adnexa</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">At the start of Chapter 7 in ICD-10-CM, a “use an external cause code” appears following the code for the eye condition to identify the cause of the eye condition, if applicable (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">A series of Excludes2 conditions are listed that are applicable to all conditions classifiable to Chapter 7. The conditions described in the Excludes2 note are diseases that can be coded in addition to the Chapter 7 codes for eye conditions.</p>
			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 7 in the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 7 of ICD-10-CM, which appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or at the CDC website (CDC 2023) or in appendix F.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Coding Diseases of the Eye and Adnexa <br />in ICD-10-CM Chapter 7</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Chapter 7 of ICD-10-CM contains specific codes for diseases of the eye that include infections, inflammations, lesions, deformities, and visual impairments among the many afflictions that a person can experience in the eye and the supporting structures. As stated in the Excludes2 note, diseases of the eye can be coded with conditions classified in other chapters. Diseases of the eye and adnexa coexist with infectious and parasitic diseases, diabetes, eye injuries, and other conditions. Coding diseases of the eye requires the coder’s attention to detail including the specific forms of the disease and whether the condition occurs on the right side, left side, or is present in both eyes. A diagram of the eye and its structures is shown in figure 10.1.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Disorders of the Eyelid, Lacrimal System and Orbit <br />(H00–H05)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">ICD-10-CM codes in the range of H00–H05 describe disorders of the eyelid, lacrimal system, and orbit. The lacrimal system, as seen in figure 10.2, is a collection of structures that produce tears and drain the tears from the surface of the eyeball (Mosby 2022). The orbits are a pair of bony cavities in the skull that house the eyeballs and associated eye muscles, nerves, and blood vessels (Mosby 2022). Examples of conditions coded to the range of codes H00–H05 <br />include hordeolum, chalazion, entropion, ectropion, blepharochalasis, inflammations, deformities of the lacrimal system and orbit, and other conditions. The codes include specific codes for the right eye, right upper and lower eyelid, left eye, left upper and lower eyelid, 
			<span id="page269" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 269"></span>
			and bilateral eyes, and a code for those conditions that do not have the laterality documented, for example:</p>
			<p class="IL_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">H00.11, Chalazion right upper eyelid</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H00.12, Chalazion right lower eyelid</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8">H00.1<span class="CharOverride-4">3, Chalazion right eye, unspecified eyelid</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H00.14, Chalazion left upper eyelid</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H00.15, Chalazion left lower eyelid</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H00.16, Chalazion left eye, unspecified eyelid</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H00.19, Ch</span>alazion unspecified eye, unspecified eyelid</p>
			<p class="IL_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">H05.221, Edema of right orbit</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H05.222, Edema of left orbit</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8">H05.223, Edema <span class="CharOverride-4">of bilateral orbit</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H05.229, Edema of</span> unspecified orbit</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Disorders of Conjunctiva (H10–H11)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Disorders of the conjunctiva are classified in the range of H10–H11. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane lining of the inner surface of the eyelids and anterior part of the sclera (Mosby 2022). Included in this range of codes are acute and chronic conjunctivitis and blepharoconjunctivitis that are bacterial or viral inflammations of the conjunctiva and eyelids (Mosby 2022). <span id="page270" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 270"></span>Other conditions here include specific disorders of the conjunctiva such as pterygium, conjunctival scars, hemorrhages, cysts, and other disorders of the conjunctiva. Right eye, left eye, bilateral eyes, and unspecified sides of these conditions are classified with individual codes.</p>
			<p class="Text">A note follows the code for acute chemical conjunctivitis (H10.21-) to direct the coder to “code first” T51–T65 to identify the chemical and intent of the toxic chemical that caused the damage to the eye. The toxic chemicals could be alcohol, organic solvents, corrosive substances, soaps, and detergents, as well as pesticides and other substances. <span class="CharOverride-5">Chemical conjunctivitis</span> occurs when a person develops an inflammation of the conjunctiva after a substance gets in the eye. This event is an injury, and that is the reason the T51–T65 code is used first. As a result of the exposure to the chemical, the patient suffers eye pain, redness, and swelling. Often this is an occupational injury with workers in the construction, manufacturing, and agriculture industry injured when working with chemicals. The treatment usually occurs in an Emergency Department or Urgent Care Center with prolonged eye washing, antibiotic eyedrops, and artificial tears prescribed.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-5">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient was exposed to an accidental release of chlorine gas in the manufacturing plant where he worked and developed acute bilateral eye pain. The patient was diagnosed with acute bilateral chemical conjunctivitis due to chlorine gas and coded as follows:</p>
			<p class="IL_first ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-4">T59.4X1A, Toxic effect of chlorine gas, accidental, initial encounter</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-4">H10.213, Acute toxic conjunctivitis, bilateral</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-11">Disorders of Sclera, Cornea, Iris and Ciliary <br />Body (H15–H22)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The block of codes H15–H22 describes disorders of the sclera, cornea, iris, and ciliary body as shown in the figures 10.1 and 10.2 within the diagrams of the eye and the lacrimal system. <span id="page271" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 271"></span>Conditions classified with these codes include many inflammations of these sites such as episcleritis, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and iridocyclitis. Other corneal conditions such as bullous keratopathy, corneal edema, keratoconus, and other corneal deformities are also included. Diseases of the iris and ciliary body such as hyphema and cysts of the iris as well as anterior and posterior synechiae complete the block of codes. Right eye, left eye, bilateral, and unspecified laterality are included for the conditions in these codes, for example:</p>
			<p class="IL_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">H18.10, Bullous keratopathy, unspecified eye</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H18.11, Bullous keratopathy, right eye</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H18.12, Bullous keratopathy, left eye</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-4">H18.13, Bullous keratopathy, bilateral</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Disorders of Lens (H25–H28)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Disorders of the lens (H25–H28) includes commonly coded conditions of the eye. These conditions are age-related cataract, infantile and juvenile cataract, traumatic cataract, cataract secondary to ocular disorders, drug-induced cataract, and other disorders of the lens including aphakia and dislocation of the lens. Codes also exist for laterality and bilateral conditions.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Age-Related Cataract (Category H25)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-5">cataract</span> is the opacity of the crystalline lens of the eye, or its capsule, which results in a loss of vision (NEI 2023). ICD-10-CM identifies different types of age-related or senile cataracts. A common age-related cataract in the elderly is a <span class="CharOverride-5">cortical cataract</span> (H25.01-), which creates an opacity and swelling of the entire lens in a mature cataract. The cataract is white wedge-like opacities that look like spokes around the periphery of the cortex of the lens that is part of the lens surrounding the central nucleus. Other common cataracts produce an opacity at the anterior subcapsular (anterior pole cataract, H25.03-) or the posterior subcapsular (posterior pole cataract, H25.04-) pole of the lens. <span class="CharOverride-5">Subcapsular cataracts</span> develop in the back of the eye and are more common in patients with diabetes or patients taking high doses of steroid medications. Other age-related cataracts are <span class="CharOverride-5">nuclear cataracts</span>, or an opacity in the central nucleus of the eye (H25.1-), or <span class="CharOverride-5">morgagnian type cataracts</span> (H25.2-), which are a mature cataract in which the cortex has liquefied, and the nucleus moves freely in the lens. Examples of cataracts are coded as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H25.011, Cortical age-related cataract, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H25.12, Age-related nuclear cataract, left eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H25.21, Age-related cataract, morgagnian type, right eye</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Infantile and Juvenile Cataract (H26.0-)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-5">Infantile and juvenile cataracts</span> are congenital cataracts that are present at birth but may not be identified until the child is older (MedicineNet 2022). Cataracts that require treatment include lamellar, polar, total, or nuclear types. Congenital cataracts may occur as part of other birth defects such as congenital rubella, Down syndrome, familial congenital cataract, and trisomy 13 (NLM 2023). The cataracts in category H26.0- are coded according to the type: cortical, lamellar, zonular, nuclear, or polar as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H26.011, Infantile and juvenile cortical, lamellar, or zonular cataract, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H26.032, Infantile and juvenile nuclear cataract, left eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H26.041, Anterior subcapsular polar infantile and juvenile cataract, right eye</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="_-hd">Disorders of Choroid and Retina (H30–H36)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Codes in the range of H30–H36 are describing disorders of choroid and retina including the laterality. The more frequently coded conditions in this section are retinal detachments, retinopathy due to hypertension, vasculitis, prematurity, and macular degeneration of various types.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Retinal Detachments and Breaks (H33)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-5">retinal detachment</span> is the separation of the inner layers of the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium that is attached to the choroid (NEI 2023). The choroid is a vascular membrane containing large branched pigment cells sandwiched between the retina and sclera. Separation of the sensory retina from the underlying epithelium occurs in different ways. A hole, tear, or break occurs when fluid from the vitreous cavity seeps in between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium, the cell layer that nourishes the retina. This type is called a <span class="CharOverride-5">rhegmatogenous detachment</span> or a retinal detachment with a retinal break (H33.0-). This is the most common type of detachment. Rhegma means a break. Vitreous fluid enters the break and separates the sensory retina from the epithelium resulting in the “detachment” (NEI 2022c).</p>
			<p class="Text">The second type is a <span class="CharOverride-5">traction detachment</span> of the retina (H33.4-), which is caused by traction from inflammatory or vascular fibrous membranes on the surface of the retina, which attaches to the vitreous. The most common causes of tractional retinal detachment are proliferative diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell disease, advanced retinopathy of prematurity, and penetrating trauma. Vitreoretinal traction increases with age, as the vitreous gel shrinks and collapses over time, frequently causing posterior vitreous detachments in approximately two-thirds of persons older than 70 years (NEI 2022c).</p>
			<p class="Text">Symptoms of a retinal detachment are what may be described as vitreous “floaters,” which is a floating spot or oval in the patient’s vision. Another symptom a patient may describe is tiny black flecks appearing suddenly. Later as the condition progresses, the patients describe cobwebs in their vision. Other common symptoms described by patients are flashing lights or prisms with floaters in their vision (NEI 2022c). Examples of retinal detachments and breaks are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H33.011, Retinal detachment with single break, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H33.052, Total retinal detachment, left eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">H33.311, Horseshoe tear of retina without detachment, right eye</p>
			<span id="page273" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 273"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Retinopathy of Prematurity (H35.1-)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-5">Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)</span> is a serious vasoproliferative disorder involving the developing retina in premature infants (NEI 2022b). ROP primarily affects premature infants weighing about 2¾ pounds or less and born before 31 weeks of gestation. The disorder usually develops in both eyes and is one of the most common causes of visual loss in childhood and can produce lifelong vision impairment. Mild forms usually cause little or no vision loss. Severe forms lead to vision loss due to retinal scarring and damage. Even with optimal treatment, many preterm infants will develop some level of ROP, especially the smallest and most premature infants. Retrolental fibroplasia is an older medical term used to describe the condition in which the retina is actually scarred. Codes in the range of H35.10- through H35.17- identify the specific stages of ROP as well as retrolental fibroplasia. Codes for retinopathy of prematurity identify the stage of the disorder and the right eye, left eye, or bilateral status of the disease. For example:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H35.111, Retinopathy of prematurity, stage 0, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H35.143, Retinopathy of prematurity, stage 3, bilateral</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H35.172, Retrolental fibroplasia, left eye</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-18">Specific forms of glaucoma are coded with ICD-10-CM codes in the block of codes from H40 and H42. The official coding guidelines describe the requirement to assign as many codes from category H40, Glaucoma, as needed to identify the type of glaucoma, the affected eye, and the glaucoma stage. The stage of glaucoma is specified with a seventh character:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">0—stage unspecified</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">1—mild stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">2—moderate stage</p>

Unspecified stage should be assigned when there is no documentation regarding the stage of the glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-5">Glaucoma</span> is a group of diseases that damage the eye’s optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. The space in the front of the eye is the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber is filled with fluid known as aqueous humor that is produced continually and protects the tissues of the eye. In a normal eye, the aqueous humor flows in and out of the anterior chamber maintaining a constant pressure. In a diseased eye, the fluid does not drain out of the eye as it should, and pressure builds up in the anterior chamber. This pressure over time damages the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve impairs vision and is irreversible. If the high pressure is not treated, the damage to the optic nerve can lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension is another term that describes the high intraocular pressure in the eye that has not damaged the optic nerve at a point in time (NEI 2022a).</p>
			<p class="Text">Category H40 is subdivided to identify the various types of glaucoma. Subcategory codes exist for glaucoma suspect (H40.0-), open-angle glaucoma (H40.1-), and primary angle-closure glaucoma (H40.2-). Other forms of glaucoma are the result of eye trauma (H40.3-), eye <span id="page275" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 275"></span>inflammation (H40.4-), secondary to other eye diseases (H40.5-), or due to the adverse effects of prescription drugs (H40.6-).</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-5">Glaucoma suspect</span> (H40.0-) is a condition identified in a patient who has risk factors that may cause glaucoma in the future. When described as having glaucoma suspect, the patient does not have damage to the optic nerve as the result of the increased pressure in the anterior chamber, but there is an abnormal appearance of the optic nerve upon examination. The patients are monitored over time to begin treatment if glaucoma is found. Glaucoma suspect is the name of this condition and should not be considered the equivalent of a diagnosis stated as “suspected” glaucoma. Examples of this type of glaucoma are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H40.003, Preglaucoma, unspecified, bilateral</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.011, Open angle with borderline findings, low risk, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">H40.062, Primary angle closure without glaucoma damage, left eye</p>
			<p class="Text">Open-angle glaucoma (H40.1-) is a chronic form of glaucoma that gets its name from the fact that the angle between the iris and the cornea remains open and looks normal upon examination of the eye. However, for an unknown reason, the draining system in the eye fails to function correctly. This causes pressure to build up in the eye slowly and gradually damages the optic nerve. The patient has no visual symptoms, has no pain in the eye, and only experiences vision problems as the nerve damage progresses. Physicians may describe this form of glaucoma as simple chronic glaucoma or low-tension glaucoma, and it usually affects both eyes. Examples of open-angle glaucoma are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H40.1191, Primary open-angle glaucoma, mild stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.1223, Low-tension glaucoma, left eye, severe stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">H40.151, Residual stage of open-angle glaucoma, right eye</p>
			<p class="Text">Primary angle-closure glaucoma (H40.2-) is an acute form of the disease. This form occurs suddenly with significant eye pain and visual defects. The disease is called angle-closure because the angle between the iris and the cornea closes and prevents the aqueous humor from draining, raising pressure in the anterior chamber. Usually this “attack” of glaucoma affects one eye. The occurrence of primary angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency and if left untreated will result in permanent damage to the patient’s vision in less than two days. The emergency is usually treated with surgery to open the blockage and allow normal flow of aqueous humor. Physicians may describe this form of glaucoma as acute angle-closure glaucoma, acute glaucoma, or a glaucoma attack or crisis. It may also be described as narrow-angle glaucoma. A chronic and intermittent form of angle-closure glaucoma also exists when the normal flow of drainage cannot be sustained. Examples of primary angle-closure glaucoma are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H40.211, Acute angle-closure glaucoma, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.2223, Chronic angle-closure glaucoma, left eye, severe stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">H40.233, Intermittent angle-closure glaucoma, bilateral</p>
			<p class="Text">There are also secondary forms of glaucoma that develop as a complication of other diseases. Secondary glaucoma can be the result of eye trauma and eye inflammations such as uveitis, as well as a complication of eye surgery or a complication of advanced cataracts left untreated. Secondary forms of glaucoma are coded in ICD-10-CM as glaucoma secondary to eye trauma (H40.3-), secondary to eye inflammation (H40.4-), secondary to other eye disorders (H40.5-), and glaucoma secondary to drugs (H40.6-). Patients developing glaucoma <span id="page276" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 276"></span>as a result of corticosteroid therapy are classified to subcategory H40.6. A “use additional code” note appears beneath subcategory H40.6 to code the drug that is causing the adverse effect of glaucoma that would be in the range of T36–T50 with the fifth or sixth character 5. Examples of the secondary forms of glaucoma are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H40.31X1, Glaucoma secondary to eye trauma, right eye, mild stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.42X2, Glaucoma secondary to eye inflammation, left eye, moderate stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.53X2, Glaucoma secondary to other eye disorders, bilateral, moderate stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.63X3, Glaucoma secondary to drugs, bilateral, severe stage</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">T38.0X5A, Adverse effect of glucocorticoids and synthetic analogues, initial encounter (the seventh character depends on the episode of care)</p>
			<p class="Text">Subcategory H40.83- includes codes for aqueous misdirection, also known as malignant glaucoma. It is not “malignant” as in the sense of a cancerous condition. The term “malignant” is used in medicine to identify any condition that is severe and becomes progressively worse over time. Aqueous misdirection is usually a complication of eye surgery and requires additional surgical treatment. It is neither angle-closure nor open-angle glaucoma. In this form of glaucoma, the aqueous flows into the vitreous or posteriorly instead of flowing into the anterior chamber. Finally, if documentation in the health record states glaucoma only, code H40.9, Unspecified glaucoma, should be assigned. Examples of these conditions are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H40.833, Aqueous misdirection, bilateral</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.89, Other specified glaucoma</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H40.9, Unspecified glaucoma</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Blindness and Low Vision (H54–H54.8)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">A new guideline appears in the <span class="Italic _idGenCharOverride-1">Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> Part I.C.7b that must be reviewed prior to coding for blindness and low vision. Included in the guidelines are the following directions: If “blindness” or “low vision” of both eyes is documented but the visual impairment category is not documented, assign code H54.3, Unqualified visual loss, both eyes. If “blindness” or “low vision” in one eye is documented but the visual impairment category is not documented, assign a code from H54.6-, Unqualified visual loss, one eye. If “blindness” or “visual loss” is documented without any information about whether one or both eyes are affected, assign code H54.7, Unspecified visual loss.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-19">Intraoperative and Postprocedural Complications and Disorders of Eye <br />and Adnexa, Not Elsewhere Classified</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The final category in this chapter is H59, for intraoperative and postprocedural complications and disorders of the eye and adnexa, not elsewhere classified. These include disorders of the eye following cataract surgery as well as eye conditions that are complications of ophthalmic and other procedures. Codes in this section also identify if the right eye, left eye, or both eyes (bilateral) are affected by the complication.</p>
			<p class="Text">There are three specific disorders of the eye that occur following cataract surgery: keratopathy (bullous aphakic), cataract (lens) fragments in the eye, and cystoid macular edema. Codes in the range of H59.0- to H59.09- identify these conditions. <span class="CharOverride-5">Bullous keratopathy</span> <span id="page277" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 277"></span>(H59.01-) is a condition of the cornea with excess accumulation of fluid in the cornea. It occurs occasionally after cataract extraction from the loss of corneal endothelium as the result of surgery. The patients report that their vision is not as clear as it was immediately after surgery. Any type of intraocular surgery, especially cataract surgery, may damage endothelial cells and hasten the decline in endothelial cell count. Various treatments exist for this condition from simple observing to see if the condition resolves after the surgery to the most intensive therapy being a corneal transplant (Roat 2022).</p>
			<p class="Text">An infrequent but well-known complication of cataract surgery is some form of <span class="CharOverride-5">retained lens fragments</span>, particularly posterior dislocation of lens fragments. This is coded as H59.02-, Cataract (lens) fragments in eye following cataract surgery. Depending on the severity of the case, associated side effects range from uncomfortable inflammation and elevated intraocular pressure to cystoid macular edema and retinal detachment. With timely and appropriate management, the final visual outcome for the majority of patients with retained lens material is positive. Removing the retained lens fragments is usually a straightforward task for the ophthalmologist with a pars plana vitrectomy, effective for removing retained lens fragments, lowering the intraocular pressure, and reducing inflammation (Vision and Eye Health 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-5">Cystoid macular edema (CME)</span> (H59.03-) is a complication that occurs during the first year after cataract surgery in a very small number of patients who have had a lens extraction procedure. It is a disease of the macula or the central retina. It is painless with multiple cyst-like areas of fluid that causes retinal swelling. The symptoms of the edema include blurred, decreased central vision and a painless swelling of the eye. The retinal inflammation is treated with anti-inflammatory medications that can be administered as eyedrops, by injection, or as medications taken orally. Sometime diuretics help reduce the swelling. If necessary, a vitrectomy is done to relieve the pressure of the vitreous pulling on the macular (Comer 2023). Examples of this complication following cataract surgery are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">H59.031, Cystoid macular edema following cataract surgery, right eye</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">H59.032, Cystoid macular edema following cataract surgery, left eye</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">The procedures performed on the eye appear in the ICD-10-PCS code book in tables that start with the two characters 0 and 8, followed by five characters representing root operation, body part, approach, device, and qualifier:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">Character 1 is Value 0—Medical and Surgical</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-13">Character 2 is Value 8—Eye</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Root Operation</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Character 3 of the ICD-10-PCS codes in the Medical Surgical section is the root operation. The root operations that represent the objectives of procedures for surgical treatment of the diseases of the eye and adnexa are shown in table 10.1.</p>
			<span id="page279" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 9"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Body Part</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Character 4 identifies the body part involved in the procedure. The body parts in ICD-10-PCS have individual values that include laterality, as shown in table 10.2.</p>

			<span id="page281" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 281"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Device</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Character 6 identifies if a device remains in the patient’s body after the procedure is concluded. The devices used to code procedures performed on organs within the eye and adnexa are limited to the devices as shown in table 10.4.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Qualifier</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Character 7 is a qualifier that specifies an additional attribute of the procedure, if applicable. The qualifier characters used to code procedures performed on organs within the eye and adnexa are four values as shown in table 10.5. The qualifier value of X for diagnostic procedure is available for the root operations of Drainage and Excision.</p>
			<span id="page282" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 282"></span>
			<p class="Text">Procedures performed on the eye are included in the tables from 080–08X with the root operations Alteration, Bypass, Change, Destruction, Dilation, Drainage, Excision, Extirpation, Extraction, Fragmentation, Insertion, Inspection, Occlusion, Reattachment, Release, Removal, Repair, Replacement, Reposition, Resection, Supplement, Restriction, Revision, and Transfer. Like procedures in other body systems, in order to code eye procedures, the coder needs to know the definition of root operations and the anatomy of the eye to identify the body parts.</p>
			<p class="Text">Using strictly the titles of operations of eye procedures is not sufficient to code in ICD-10-PCS. A term used by a physician may be the equivalent of multiple possible root operations that the coder has to analyze by reading the operative report to determine the primary objective of the procedure (what the procedure accomplished). For example, consider the following eye procedure terminology and the possible root operations that may be used based on what was performed:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">Keratoplasty:</p>
			<p class="IL-sub ParaOverride-20"><span class="CharOverride-4">– Repair (LASIK to correct refractive error)</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub ParaOverride-20"><span class="CharOverride-4">– Replacement (Corneal transplant)</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub ParaOverride-20"><span class="CharOverride-4">– Supplement (Lamellar keratoplasty)</span></p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12">Phacoemulsification:</p>
			<p class="IL-sub ParaOverride-20"><span class="CharOverride-4">– Replacement (if an intraocular lens (IOL) is inserted)</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub ParaOverride-21"><span class="CharOverride-4">– Extraction (if there is no IOL inserted)</span></p>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-PCS procedures are produced by building a code using the values provided for each root operation performed on a particular body system and body part. A keratoplasty is surgery on the cornea that may also be called corneal transplant or corneal grafting. A penetrating keratoplasty is the removal of the full thickness of the cornea and replacing it with donor corneal tissue. Usually this is called a corneal transplant. A lamellar keratoplasty is a partial-thickness graft of the cornea. In this procedure, only the epithelium and superficial stroma of the cornea are removed and are replaced with donor tissue that supplements the remaining corneal tissue that was not removed from the eye. Based on the type of keratoplasty performed, the root operation may be Repair as the procedure is restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function. A Replacement is defined as putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place or function of all or a portion of a body part. The Supplement root operation, defined as putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically reinforces or augments the function of a portion of a body part, is used for the lamellar keratoplasty as the donor tissue reinforces the existing cornea in the patient’s eye (Dorland 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">For cataract surgery, the root operation may be Replacement or Extraction depending on whether the intraocular lens is placed in the eye at the same procedure. Replacement is used when the artificial lens is placed in the eye to replace the lens that was removed with the cataract. Extraction, defined as pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force, is the root operation when the cataract or the diseased lens in the eye is removed without replacement by an artificial lens during the same procedure.</p>
