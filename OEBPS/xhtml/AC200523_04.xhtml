			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">In ICD-10-CM Chapter 1, a separate subchapter, or block, has been created and appropriate conditions have been grouped together for infections with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission (A50–A64). Two additional examples of separate blocks with the appropriate conditions grouped together are viral hepatitis (B15–B19) and other viral diseases (B25–B34).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The term sepsis is used throughout ICD-10-CM Chapter 1. The medical term septicemia may be found in medical records. Physicians may use septicemia as an equivalent term for sepsis. Category A41, Other sepsis, includes a code first note, and Excludes1 and Excludes2 notes to indicate how particular types of sepsis are coded as well.</span></p>

			<p class="CG_list1"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span>&#9;Code only confirmed cases</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent">Code only confirmed cases of HIV infection/illness. This is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H. In this context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of positive serology or culture for HIV; the provider’s diagnostic statement that the patient is HIV positive or has an HIV-related illness is sufficient.</p>
			<p class="CG_list1"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">2.</span>&#9;Selection and sequencing of HIV codes</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">a.</span>&#9;Patient admitted for HIV-related condition</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-8">&#9;If a patient is admitted for an HIV-related condition, <br />the principal diagnosis should be B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease followed by additional diagnosis codes for all reported &#173;HIV-related conditions.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-8">&#9;An exception to this guideline is if the reason for admission is hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with HIV disease. Assign code D59.31, Infection-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome, followed <span id="page114" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 114"></span>by code B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">b.</span>&#9;Patient with HIV disease admitted for unrelated condition</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-8">&#9;If a patient with HIV disease is admitted for an unrelated condition (such as a traumatic injury), the code for the unrelated condition (e.g., the nature of injury code) should be the principal diagnosis. Other &#173;diagnoses would be B20 followed by additional diagnosis codes for all reported HIV-related conditions.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">c.</span>&#9;Whether the patient is newly diagnosed</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">Whether the patient is newly diagnosed or has had previous admissions/encounters for HIV conditions is irrelevant to the sequencing decision.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">d.</span>&#9;Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">Z21, Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status, is to be applied when the patient without any documentation of symptoms is listed as being “HIV positive,” “known HIV,” “HIV test positive,” or similar terminology. Do not use this code if the term “AIDS” or “HIV disease” is used or if the patient is treated for any HIV-related illness or is described as having any condition(s) resulting from his/her HIV positive status; use B20 in these cases.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">e.</span>&#9;Patients with inconclusive HIV serology</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">Patients with inconclusive HIV serology, but no definitive diagnosis or manifestations of the illness, may be assigned code R75, Inconclusive laboratory evidence of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV].</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">f.</span>&#9;Previously diagnosed HIV-related illness</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">Patients with any known prior diagnosis of an &#173;HIV-related illness should be coded to B20. Once a patient has developed an HIV-related illness, the patient should always be assigned code B20 on every subsequent admission/encounter. Patients &#173;previously diagnosed with any HIV illness (B20) should never be assigned to R75 or Z21, Asymptomatic human &#173;immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">g.</span>&#9;HIV Infection in Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">During pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, a patient admitted (or presenting for a health care encounter) because of an HIV-related illness should receive a principal diagnosis code of O98.7-, Human immunodeficiency [HIV] disease complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, followed by <span id="page115" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 115"></span>B20 and the code(s) for the HIV-related illness(es). Codes from Chapter 15 always take sequencing priority. Patients with asymptomatic HIV infection status admitted (or presenting for a health care encounter) during pregnancy, childbirth, or the puerperium should receive codes of O98.7- and Z21.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">h.</span>&#9;Encounters for testing for HIV</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">If a patient is being seen to determine his/her HIV status, use code Z11.4, Encounter for &#173;screening for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]. Use &#173;additional codes for any associated high risk &#173;behavior, if applicable.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">If a patient with signs or symptoms is being seen for HIV testing, code the signs and symptoms. An additional counseling code Z71.7, Human &#173;immunodeficiency virus [HIV] counseling, may be used if counseling is provided during the encounter for the test.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">When a patient returns to be informed of his/her HIV test results and the test result is negative, use code Z71.7, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] counseling. If the results are positive, see previous guidelines and assign codes as appropriate.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">i.</span>&#9;HIV managed by antiretroviral medication</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">If a patient with documented HIV disease, HIV-related illness or AIDS is currently managed on antiretroviral medications, assign code B20, Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease. Code Z79.899, Other long term (current) drug therapy, may be assigned as an additional code to identify the long-term (current) use of antiretroviral medications.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">J.</span>&#9;Encounter for HIV Prophylaxis Measures</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">When a patient is seen for administration of pre-&#173;exposure prophylaxis medication for HIV, assign code Z29.81, Encounter for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is intended to prevent infection in people who are at risk for getting HIV through sex or injection drug use. Any risk factors for HIV should also be coded.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.1.b. Infectious Agents as the Cause of Diseases Classified to Other Chapters</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Certain infections are classified in chapters other than Chapter 1 and no organism is identified as part of the infection code. <br /><span id="page116" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 116"></span>In these instances, it is necessary to use an additional code from Chapter 1 to identify the organism. A code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, B96, Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, or B97, Viral agents as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters, is to be used as an additional code to identify the organism. An instructional note will be found at the infection code advising that an additional organism code is required.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.1.c. Infections Resistant to Antibiotics</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Many bacterial infections are resistant to current antibiotics. It is necessary to identify all infections documented as &#173;antibiotic resistant. Assign a code from category Z16, Resistance to &#173;antimicrobial drugs, following the infection code only if the &#173;infection code does not identify drug resistance.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.1.d. Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock Infections resistant to antibiotics</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-5">1.</span>&#9;Coding of sepsis and severe sepsis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-5">a.</span>&#9;Sepsis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-sub-indent">For a diagnosis of sepsis, assign the appropriate code for the underlying systemic infection. If the type of infection or causal organism is not further specified, assign code A41.9, Sepsis, unspecified organism.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt-ind">A code from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis, should not be assigned unless severe sepsis or an associated acute organ dysfunction is documented.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">i.</span>&#9;Negative or inconclusive blood cultures and sepsis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-sub-indent">Negative or inconclusive blood cultures do not preclude a diagnosis of sepsis in patients with clinical evidence of the condition, however, the provider should be queried.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">ii.</span>&#9;Urosepsis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">The term urosepsis is a nonspecific term. It is not to be considered synonymous with sepsis. It has no default code in the Alphabetic Index. Should a provider use this term, he/she must be queried for clarification.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">iii.</span>&#9;Sepsis with organ dysfunction</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">If a patient has sepsis and associated acute organ dysfunction or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD), follow the instructions for coding severe sepsis.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">iv.</span>&#9;Acute organ dysfunction that is not clearly &#173;associated with the sepsis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">If a patient has sepsis and an acute organ &#173;dysfunction, but the medical record documentation &#173;indicates that <span id="page117" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 117"></span>the acute organ dysfunction is related to a &#173;medical condition other than the &#173;sepsis, do not assign a code from subcategory R65.2, Severe &#173;sepsis. An acute organ dysfunction must be &#173;associated with the sepsis in order to assign the severe sepsis code. If the documentation is not clear as to whether an acute organ dysfunction is related to the sepsis or another medical condition, query the provider.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent"><span class="CharOverride-5">b.</span>&#9;Severe sepsis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-9">The coding of severe sepsis requires a minimum of 2 codes: first a code for the underlying &#173;systemic infection, followed by a code from subcategory R65.2, Severe sepsis. If the causal organism is not documented, assign code A41.9, Sepsis, &#173;unspecified organism, for the infection. Additional code(s) for the associated acute organ dysfunction are also required. Due to the complex nature of severe &#173;sepsis, some cases may require querying the &#173;provider prior to assignment of the codes.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">2.</span>&#9;Septic shock</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-indent ParaOverride-12">Septic shock generally refers to circulatory &#173;failure &#173;associated with severe sepsis, and therefore, it &#173;represents a type of acute organ dysfunction. For cases of septic shock, the code for the systemic infection should be sequenced first, followed by code R65.21, Severe sepsis with septic shock or code T81.12, Postprocedural septic shock. Any additional codes for the other acute organ dysfunctions should also be assigned.

The body’s immune system releases chemicals into the blood to fight the infection and triggers widespread inflammation. This inflammation causes blood clots and other complications in the vascular system. This impairs blood flow and damages the body organs by depriving the structures of oxygen and nutrients. Sepsis does not occur without another reason, especially in the lungs, abdomen, urinary tract, or skin. Surgical and invasive medical procedures can cause sepsis by introducing bacteria into the bloodstream. The pathologic organisms in the blood or tissue may include bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other organisms that produce a systemic disease (National Institute of General Medical Sciences 2021).</span></p>

Because streptococcal sepsis may occur after a procedure, immunization, or infusion as well as during labor or following an abortion or ectopic or molar pregnancy, a “code first” note exists to remind the coder that other codes should be assigned first to reflect those conditions.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Sepsis caused by other organisms than </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Streptococcus</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is classified to Category A41, Other sepsis.

The Tabular List reminds the coder that code R65.20 or R65.21 for severe sepsis without or with septic shock cannot be used as the principal, first listed, or the only code.

People living with HIV may </span><span class="CharOverride-1">appear and feel healthy for several years. However, even if they feel healthy, HIV is still affect</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ing their bodies. Many people with HIV, including those who feel healthy, can benefit greatly from current medications used to treat HIV infection. These medications can limit or slow down the <br />destruction of the immune system, can improve the health of people living with HIV, and may reduce their ability to transmit HIV. Untreated early HIV infection is also associated with many diseases including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer. Figure 4.1 shows a human T cell that is under attack by HIV virus cells that appear as the tiny specks on the surface of the T cell. The HIV virus specifically targets the T cells, which play a critical role in the body’s immune response against invaders like bacteria and viruses. As the HIV virus destroys the T cells, the body is less capable of resisting infections and succumbs to AIDS-related illnesses as a result of the body’s diminished immune defenses. The number of T cells present in the blood can be measured by laboratory testing. The lower the T-cell count, the more likely the person will become ill as it is a measure of the health of the person’s immune <span id="page129" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 129"></span>system.

Before the development of antiviral medications, people with HIV could progress to AIDS in a short period of time. Today, people can live much longer with HIV before they develop AIDS. This is because of antiviral medications that a person can tolerate over an indefinite period of time. Another treatment is to prevent opportunistic infections that can prove fatal in a person with the HIV infection.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Commonly, sepsis and other infections are treated with long-term antibiotic therapy through a <br />central venous access catheter. This long-term therapy usually requires the insertion of a&#160;peripherally inserted central catheter, also known as a PICC line. The correct coding of a venous catheter of this type depends on the end placement of the catheter, that is, the internal site where the catheter tip is located. A PICC line may be inserted in the right internal jugular and then inserted through the vein into the superior vena cava that qualifies it as a central line. The ICD-10-PCS code for a PICC line insertion is 02HV33Z, insertion of infusion device into superior vena cava by a percutaneous approach.</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A patient may acquire sepsis from a disease in the digestive system, especially if there is a rupture or perforation of the intestine that allows organisms to escape and contaminate the internal cavity. Repairing the intestine likely will involve taking out some or all of a body part. The root operation Excision would be used for cutting out or off without replacement a part of the intestine as identified by the body part values in the Table. The root operation Resection would be used for cutting out or off without replacement all of a body part, as identified by one of the values of the body parts for the gastrointestinal system. For example, excision by laparotomy of a portion of the ascending colon would be 0DBK0ZZ. In comparison, if the entire ascending colon was removed by laparotomy the procedure would be coded as a resection with 0DTK0ZZ. The Index entries for either of these intestinal procedures would be “excision, colon, ascending” and “resection, colon, ascending.”</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Intestinal procedures may include a bypass procedure to completely treat the condition. The root operation Bypass is the altering of the route of passage of the contents of a tubular body party. A bypass can be considered a “rerouting” procedure, thereby, redirecting the &#173;contents of a tubular body part, such as an intestine, to travel through a different path. The&#160;bypass can send contents in a downstream route or to a similar body part or route. <br />A bypass can also send contents to an abnormal route and different body parts such as to an external location other than a natural orifice. For non–coronary artery bypass, the body part values (character 4) indicate where the bypass originates or starts and the qualifier content indicates where the bypass goes to or ends (character 7). The Index entry is “Bypass” with the&#160;subterm for the anatomic location when the bypass originates. For example, a bypass of the ascending colon as a colostomy would be coded as 0D1K0Z4. The Index entry in this example </span><span id="page142" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 142"></span><span class="CharOverride-1">would be “Bypass, ascending colon,” as this is where the bypass originated. The documentation </span><span class="CharOverride-1">of this procedure would likely describe the open procedure as directing the contents of the ascending colon to come out of the body through the skin as a stoma. For this example, Table 0D1 would include the fourth character K for ascending colon, fifth character 0 for open, sixth character device Z for no device used, and seventh character 4 for cutaneous, which is the skin level of a colostomy.</span></p>
