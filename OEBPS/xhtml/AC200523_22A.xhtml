			<p class="Text">This chapter focuses on the ICD-10-CM coding of injuries (S00–T34). The coding of drug-related illnesses (T35–T88) such as poisoning, adverse effects, and underdosing of drugs is addressed in Chapter 22B of this text.</p>
			<p class="Text">Specific types of injuries found in categories S00–S99 of Chapter 19 of ICD-10-CM are arranged by body region beginning with the head and concluding with the ankle and foot. This results in the grouping of injury types together under the site where it occurred.</p>
			<p class="Text">In addition, generally the listings of conditions that follow the anatomic site are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">Superficial injury</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Open wound</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Fracture</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Dislocation and sprain</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Injury of nerves</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Injury of blood vessels</li>

				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Traumatic amputation</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Other and unspecified injuries</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM uses the terms “displaced” and “nondisplaced” in the code descriptor for fracture. Codes from blocks T20–T32 classify burns and corrosions. The burn codes identify thermal burns, except for sunburns, that come from a heat source. The burn codes are also for burns resulting from electricity and radiation. Corrosions are burns due to chemicals.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes <br />for the Injury Portion of ICD-10-CM Chapter 19</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The following guideline appears at the beginning of ICD-10-CM Chapter 19: “Use secondary code(s) from ICD-10-CM Chapter 20: External Causes of Morbidity, to indicate cause of injury. Codes within the T section that include the external cause do not require an additional external cause code” (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">Instructions for coding open wounds are included in ICD-10-CM. ICD-10-CM contains a note under the different categories for open wounds and directs the coding professional to code also any associated injuries or wound infection.</p>
			<p class="Text">Most categories in ICD-10-CM Chapter 19 have seventh characters that identify the encounter:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-5">A—Initial encounter</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">D—Subsequent encounter</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-7">S—Sequela</p>
			<p class="Text">The fracture categories in Chapter 19 have different seventh characters that identify the fracture-care encounter:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-5">A—Initial encounter for closed fracture</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">B—Initial encounter for open fracture or open fracture type I or II</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">C—Initial encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">D—Subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">E—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type I or II with routine healing</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">F—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC with routine healing</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">G—Subsequent encounter for fracture with delayed healing</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">H—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type I or II with delayed healing</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">J—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC with delayed healing</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">K—Subsequent encounter for fracture with nonunion</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">M—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type I or II with nonunion</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">N—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC with nonunion</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">P—Subsequent encounter for fracture with malunion</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">Q—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type I or II with malunion</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">R—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC with malunion</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-7">S—Sequela</p>
			<p class="Text">The seventh characters for fractures are unique to each type of bone and type of fracture. Not all of these seventh characters are used with every fracture site. It is necessary to review the fracture carefully before assigning a seventh character.</p>
			<span id="page590" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 590"></span>
			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 19 in the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 19 of ICD-10-CM that appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or on the CDC website (CDC 2023) or in appendix F.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">Chapter 19: Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of<br />external causes (S00–T34)</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.a. Application of 7th Characters in Chapter 19:</span> Most categories in chapter 19 have a 7th character requirement for each applicable <br />code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character <br />values (with the exception of fractures): A, initial encounter, <br />D, subsequent encounter and S, sequela. Categories for traumatic fractures have additional 7th character values. While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the course of treatment for an injury, assignment of the 7th character is based on whether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider is seeing the patient for the first time.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">For complication codes, active treatment refers to treatment for the condition described by the code, even though it may be related to an earlier precipitating problem. For example, code T84.50XA, Infection and inflammatory reaction due to unspecified internal joint prosthesis, initial encounter, is used when active treatment is provided for the infection, even though the condition related to the prosthetic device, implant or graft that was placed at a previous encounter.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">7th character “A”, initial encounter is used for each encounter where the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8">7th character “D” subsequent encounter is used for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8">The aftercare Z codes should not be used for aftercare for conditions such as injuries or poisonings, where 7th characters are provided to identify subsequent care. For example, for aftercare of an injury, assign the acute injury code with the 7th character “D” (subsequent encounter).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8">7th character “S”, sequela, is for use for complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of a condition, such as scar formation after a burn. The scars are sequelae of the burn. When using 7th character “S”, it is necessary to use both the&#160;injury code that precipitated the sequela and the code for the <br />sequela itself. The “S” is added only to the injury code, not the sequela code. The 7th character “S” identifies the injury responsible for the sequela. The specific type of sequela (e.g. scar) is sequenced first, followed by the injury code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">See Section I.B.10 Sequelae, (Late Effects)</span></p>
			<span id="page591" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 591"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.b. Coding of Injuries:</span> When coding injuries, assign separate codes for each injury unless a combination code is provided, in which case the combination code is assigned. Codes from category T07, Unspecified multiple injuries should not be assigned in the inpatient setting unless information for a more specific code is not available. Traumatic injury codes (S00–T14.9) are not to be used for normal, healing surgical wounds or to identify complications of surgical wounds.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The code for the most serious injury, as determined by the &#173;provider and the focus of treatment, is sequenced first.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.b.1. Superficial injuries:</span> Superficial injuries such as abrasions or contusions are not coded when associated with more severe injuries of the same site.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.b.2. Primary injury with damage to nerves/blood vessels:</span> When a primary injury results in minor damage to peripheral nerves or blood vessels, the primary injury is sequenced first with additional code(s) for injuries to nerves and spinal cord (such as category S04), and/or injury to blood vessels (such as category S15). When the primary injury is to the blood vessels or nerves, that injury should be sequenced first.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.b.3. Iatrogenic injuries:</span> Injury codes from Chapter 19 should not be assigned for injuries that occur during, or as a result of, a medical intervention. Assign the appropriate complication code(s).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.c. Coding of Traumatic Fractures:</span> The principles of multiple coding of injuries should be followed in coding fractures. Fractures of specified sites are coded individually by site in accordance with both the provisions within categories S02, S12, S22, S32, S42, S49, S52, S59, S62, S72, S79, S82, S89, S92 and the level of detail furnished by medical record content.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">A fracture not indicated as open or closed should be coded to&#160;closed. A fracture not indicated whether displaced or not displaced should be coded to displaced.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">More specific guidelines are as follows:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.c.1. Initial vs. subsequent encounter for fractures:</span> Traumatic fractures are coded using the appropriate 7th character for initial encounter (A, B, C) for each encounter where the patient is receiving active treatment for the fracture. The appropriate 7th character for initial encounter should also be assigned for a patient who delayed seeking treatment for the fracture or nonunion.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Fractures are coded using the appropriate 7th character for subsequent care for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment of the fracture and is receiving routine care for the fracture during the healing or recovery phase.</p>
			<span id="page592" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 592"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Care for complications of surgical treatment for fracture repairs during the healing or recovery phase should be coded with the appropriate complication codes.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Care of complications of fractures, such as malunion and nonunion, should be reported with the appropriate 7th character for subsequent care with nonunion (K, M, N,) or subsequent care with malunion (P, Q, R).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Malunion/nonunion: The appropriate 7<span class="CharOverride-4">th</span> character for initial encounter should also be assigned for a patient who delayed seeking treatment for the fracture or nonunion.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The open fracture designations in the assignment of the 7th character for fractures of the forearm, femur and lower leg, including the ankle are based on the Gustilo open fracture &#173;classification. When the Gustilo classification type is not specified for an open fracture, the 7th character for open fracture type I or II should be assigned (B, E, H, M, Q.)</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">A code from category M80, not a traumatic fracture code, should be used for any patient with known osteoporosis who suffers a fracture, even if the patient had a minor fall or trauma, if that fall or trauma would not usually break a normal, healthy bone.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">See Section I.C.13. Osteoporosis.</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The aftercare Z codes should not be used for aftercare for &#173;traumatic fractures. For aftercare of a traumatic fracture, assign the acute fracture code with the appropriate 7th character.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.c.2. Multiple fractures sequencing:</span> Multiple fractures are sequenced in accordance with the severity of the fracture.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.c.3. Physeal fractures: </span>For physeal fractures, assign only the code identifying the type of physeal fracture. Do not assign a separate code to identify the specific bone that is fractured.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.d. Coding of Burns and Corrosions:</span> The ICD-10-CM makes a distinction between burns and corrosions. The burn codes are for thermal burns, except sunburns, that come from a heat source, such as a fire or hot appliance. The burn codes are also for burns resulting from electricity and radiation. Corrosions are burns due to chemicals. The guidelines are the same for burns and corrosions.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8">Current burns (T20–T25) are classified by depth, extent and by agent (X code). Burns are classified by depth as first degree (erythema), second degree (blistering), and third degree (full-thickness involvement). Burns of the eye and internal organs (T26–T28) are classified by site, but not by degree.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.d.1. Sequencing of burn and related condition codes:</span> Sequence first the code that reflects the highest degree of burn when more than one burn is present.</p>
			<span id="page593" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 593"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.d.1.a.</span> When the reason for the admission or encounter is for treatment of external multiple burns, sequence first the code that reflects the burn of the highest degree.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.d.1.b.</span> When a patient has both internal and external burns, the circumstances of admission govern the selection of the principal diagnosis or first-listed diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.d.1.c.</span> When a patient is admitted for burn injuries and other related conditions such as smoke inhalation and/or respiratory failure, the circumstances of admission govern the selection of the principal or first-listed diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.d.2.</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> </span><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">Burns of the same anatomic site:</span> Classify burns of the same anatomic site and on the same side but of different degrees to the subcategory identifying the highest degree recorded in the diagnosis (e.g., for second and third degree burns of right thigh, assign only code T24.311-).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.d.3. Non-healing burns:</span> Non-healing burns are coded as acute burns.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Necrosis of burned skin should be coded as a non-healed burn.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.19.d.4. Infected burn:</span> For any documented infected burn site, use an additional code for the infection.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.d.5. Assign separate codes for each burn site:</span> When coding burns, assign separate codes for each burn site. Category T30, Burn and corrosion, body region unspecified is extremely vague and should rarely be used. Codes for burns of “multiple sites” should only be assigned when the medical record documentation does not specify the individual sites.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">I.C.19.d.6.</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> </span><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">Burns and corrosions classified according to extent of </span><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">body surface involved:</span> Assign codes from category T31, Burns classified according to extent of body surface involved, or T32, Corrosions classified according to extent of body surface involved, for acute burns or corrosions when the site of the burn or corrosion is not specified or when there is a need for additional data. It is advisable to use category T31 as additional coding when needed to provide data for evaluating burn mortality, such as that needed by burn units. It is also advisable to use category T31 as an additional code for reporting purposes when there is mention of a third-degree burn involving 20 percent or more of the body surface. Codes from categories T31 and T32 should not be used for sequelae of burns or corrosions.</p>

			<p class="Text">In ICD-10-CM, injuries are grouped by body parts rather than by categories of injury, so that all injuries of the specific site (such as head and neck) are grouped together rather than groupings of all fractures or all open wounds. For example, categories are grouped by site, such as injuries to the head (S00–S09), injuries to the neck (S10–S19), injuries to the thorax (S20–S29), and so on.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">Chapter 19 encompasses two alpha characters. The S section provides codes for the various types of injuries related to single body regions; the T section covers injuries to unspecified body regions as well as poisonings and certain other consequences of external causes. For example, the codes in the ranges of S00–S99 are specific injuries to specific anatomical sites, such as the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, lower back, lumbar spine, and so on. Injury codes using the first character of T identify other and unspecified injuries sites such as T07, Unspecified multiple injuries, and T14.8, Other injury of unspecified body region.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">The codes to classify traumatic fractures start with the first character of S. The fracture codes include detailed specificity in ICD-10-CM. For example, some of the information that may be found in fracture codes includes the type of fracture, specific anatomical site, whether the fracture is displaced or not, laterality, routine versus delayed healing, nonunions, and malunions. Laterality and identification of type of encounter (initial, subsequent, sequela) are a significant component of the code expansion. A seventh character is required for many of the injury codes to identify the encounter of care.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">Because some of the injury codes are less than seven characters in length, ICD-10-CM uses a <span class="CharOverride-7">placeholder character</span> X for certain codes. The X is used as a placeholder at certain codes to allow for future expansion. For example, S01.01XA for an initial encounter for care of a laceration without foreign body of scalp requires the sixth character to have a placeholder X to allow the addition of the seventh character to indicate the initial encounter of care.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">It is common for patients to have multiple injuries as a result of an accident. Separate ICD-10-CM codes are assigned for each injury unless there is a combination code available. However, some combination codes should not be assigned. For example, code T07, Unspecified multiple injuries, should not be assigned in an inpatient setting if at all possible. The only time a code like T07 should be used is when no more specific information is available from the provider, for example, in a brief physician office visit note when the patient is transferred to an acute-care setting for care.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">When patients have multiple injuries that can be coded, the code for the most serious injury is sequenced first. The physician determines the most serious injury in a patient with multiple injuries. It is common for a patient to have both significant and superficial injuries on the same site. For example, if a patient suffers a fractured distal radius (wrist) in a fall, it is likely the patient would also have contusions and abrasions at the site of the distal radius fracture. When a patient has superficial injuries associated with a more serious injury at the same site, the code for the superficial injuries such as contusions and abrasions are not coded as the superficial injuries are expected to be present with a more serious injury.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Seventh Characters</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Most categories in Chapter 19 of ICD-10-CM have a seventh character required for each applicable code. Most categories have three applicable codes. Three seventh character values are used for most of the categories except for fractures, which have a most extensive list of seventh characters. The characters are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">The seventh character A for <span class="CharOverride-7">initial encounter</span> is used for each encounter where the patient is receiving active treatment for the injury.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">The seventh character D for <span class="CharOverride-7">subsequent encounter</span> is used for encounters after the patient has received completed active treatment of the injury and is receiving routine care for the injury during the healing or recovery phase.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">The seventh character S for <span class="CharOverride-7">sequela</span> is used for complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of an injury, such as scar formation after a burn. When using the seventh character S, <br />it is necessary to use both the injury code that precipitated the sequela and the code for the sequela itself. The S is added only to the injury code, not the sequela code. The seventh character S identifies the injury responsible for the sequela. The specific type of sequela (for example, contracture) is sequenced first, followed by the&#160;injury code (CDC 2023).</li>

			<p class="Text-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-7">traumatic fracture</span> is a break in the bone or rupture in a bone due to a traumatic injury (Dorland 2012, 740). Tenderness and swelling develop at the site of the break, with a visible or palpable deformity, pain, and weakness. X-rays show a complete, partial or an incomplete break at the site of the fracture.</p>
			<p class="Text">In ICD-10-CM, traumatic fractures are coded to the specific sites of the fracture within categories S02, S12, S22, S32, S42, S49, S52, S59, S62, S72, S79, S82, S89, and S92.

			<p class="Text">There are different types of fractures that may be described by physicians: closed, open, displaced, and nondisplaced. A <span class="CharOverride-7">closed fracture</span> is when the bone breaks but there is no puncture or open wound in the skin. An <span class="CharOverride-7">open fracture</span> is one in which the bone breaks through <br />the skin even though it may fall back into the wound and may or may not be visible through the wound. A <span class="CharOverride-7">displaced fracture</span> is described for a bone that breaks into two or more parts and the two ends of the bone are out of place and need to be realigned. This may also be called a comminuted fracture. In a <span class="CharOverride-7">nondisplaced fracture</span>, the fracture of the bone occurs with a crack either part way or all the way through the bone but the bone remains in alignment. Some fractures are more severe than others based on fracture location and damage done to the bone and surrounding tissue. Fractures can damage blood vessels and nerves around the bone. A fractured bone can become infected or develop osteomyelitis. Healing time varies depending on the type of bone as well as the age and the overall health of a patient.</p>
			<p class="Text">Figure 22A.1 shows three types of fractures. The stable, closed, or simple fractures show the fractured ends of the bone barely out of position. The oblique fracture has an angled <br />pattern where the break in the bone has occurred. The comminuted fracture occurs when the bone breaks into several pieces that require realignment for fracture healing (AAOS 2021).</p>
			<span id="page597" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 597"></span>
			<p class="Text">Figure 22A.2 illustrates an open fracture. In this example of an open fracture of the tibia, the fractured end of the bone has torn through the soft tissue and may protrude through the skin or may be visible through an open wound at the site (AAOS 2023).</p>
			<span id="page598" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 598"></span>
			<p class="Text">Figure 22A.3 are images of extra-articular and intra-articular fractures of the forearm, the radius or ulna. Illustrations of both displaced and nondisplaced fractures appear here to demonstrate how the bone is separated as a displaced fracture and how the bone remains in alignment as a nondisplaced fracture (AAOS 2022).</p>
			<p class="Text">Physicians may use other terminology to describe a fracture:</p>

				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">A <span class="CharOverride-7">comminuted fracture</span> occurs when a bone breaks into several pieces or splintered.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-7">greenstick fracture</span> is an incomplete fracture in which one side of the bone is broken and the other side of the bone is bent.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">An <span class="CharOverride-7">impacted fracture</span> occurs when the bone breaks and the ends of the bone are pushed into each other or one end of the bone impacted into the other end of the bone at the site of the break.

				<li class="Bull-list-flush">An <span class="CharOverride-7">oblique fracture</span> occurs when the bone breaks in a curved or sloped shape.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-7">pathological fracture</span> is one caused by disease that weakens the bone and breaks with minor trauma that otherwise would not break a healthy bone. Pathological fractures may occur in patients with neoplastic bone disease, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, osteomyelitis, and other diseases.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-7">Stress fractures</span> are caused by overuse or repetitive force applied to a limb or bone, most commonly occurring in the bones of the lower leg and foot of athletes who run and jump in their sport. A stress fracture appears as small cracks in a bone that does not always appear on the first imaging or x-ray. Stress fractures can also occur with normal use of a bone when the bone is weakened by disease such as osteoporosis.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-7">transverse fracture</span> is one that breaks at a right angle to the bone’s axis (Dorland 2012, 741–743).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Traumatic fractures are coded with the appropriate seventh characters to identify the episode of care: initial treatment, subsequent treatment, or to identify an injury that is the cause of a sequela. Fracture seventh characters are expanded to include options for the initial care for <span id="page599" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 599"></span>a closed versus open fracture, subsequent care that includes routine and delayed healing, complications of nonunion and malunion, and identification of a sequela situation:</p>

			<p class="Text">Some fracture categories provide for seventh characters to designate the specific type of open fracture. These seventh character designations are based on the Gustilo open fracture classification:</p>

			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-7">R—Subsequent encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC with malunion</p>
			<p class="Text">There may be complications of fracture injuries, and the care for these complications should be coded with the appropriate complication codes, such as postoperative wound infections. If there is a complication of the fracture healing such as malunion or nonunion, the code for the fracture should be reported with the seventh character for subsequent encounter for fracture with nonunion or malunion. A <span class="CharOverride-7">malunion</span> fracture (Stedman 2012, 1011) is a fractured bone that has healed in a poor alignment and may cause the bone to be shorter than it was before the break. A <span class="CharOverride-7">nonunion</span> is a fracture (Stedman 2012, 1167) that has failed to heal after several months of recovery. Both conditions cause significant impairment in the patient and usually require additional treatment including surgery.</p>
			<p class="Text">Remember that pathologic fractures due to underlying bone disease are not considered traumatic and, as such, are not classified to Chapter 19 of ICD-10-CM with the traumatic fracture codes. A code from category M80, Age related osteoporosis with pathologic fracture, should be assigned when a patient with known osteoporosis acquires a fracture from a minor injury that normally would not cause a bone to break in a person without osteoporosis.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Multiple Fractures</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">When coding fractures, the coder should assign separate codes for each fracture unless a combination code is provided in the Alphabetic Index, in which case the combination code is assigned.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-13"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Initial encounter for a patient who has a closed fracture of the distal radius and the first metacarpal bone of the right upper limb. This patient has multiple fractures, one in the distal radius or wrist and one in the first metacarpal bone of the hand. The Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries has an entry for “Fracture, traumatic, multiple, hand (and wrist) NEC—see Fracture by site.” This directs the coder to use two codes, one for each fracture site, as a combination code is not available.</p>
			<p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-13">Closed fracture of the distal radius (radius, lower end): S52.501A, Unspecified fracture of the lower end of the right radius</p>
			<p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-14">Closed fracture of the first metacarpal bone, right hand: S62.201A, Unspecified fracture of first metacarpal bone, right hand</p>
			<p class="Text">Combination categories for multiple fractures are provided for use when the health record contains a description of multiple fractures at one site but without specific details.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Initial encounter for multiple fractures of ribs right side is the only information provided in the health record: S22.41XA, Multiple fractures of ribs, right side. The Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries has an entry for “Fracture, traumatic, multiple, ribs—see Fracture, rib, multiple.” For this reason, one code can be used to classify multiple rib fractures.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Initial encounter for multiple pelvic fractures without disruption of the pelvic ring: S32.82XA, Multiple fractures of pelvic without disruption of pelvic ring. The Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries has an entry for “Fracture, traumatic, pelvis (pelvic bone), multiple, without disruption of pelvic ring (circle).” For this reason, one code can be used to classify the multiple pelvic fractures.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Dislocation and Subluxation</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-7">Dislocation</span> is the displacement of a bone from its joint, specifically a disarrangement of the normal relation of the bones that form the joint. A dislocation may also be called a luxation (Stedman 2012, 491). The joints most commonly affected are in the fingers, thumbs, and shoulders. Pain and swelling occur, as well as the loss of use of the injured part. To promote healing, the dislocation can be reduced and the joint immobilized by applying a cast. A dislocation that occurs with a fracture is included in the fracture code. The reduction of the dislocation is included in the code for the fracture reduction. Figure 22A.4 illustrates the anatomy of the shoulder joint. The human shoulder is one of the most active joints in the body. The shoulder can be rotated forward, backward, or raised upward or sideways. Because of its mobility, a shoulder can be easily dislocated when a trauma occurs. A shoulder can dislocate partially and completely. A partial dislocation occurs when the humeral head comes partially out of its socket or the glenoid process. A complete dislocation occurs then the humeral head is completely out of the glenoid socket (AAOS 2017).</p>
			<span id="page601" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 601"></span>
			<p class="Text">A <span class="CharOverride-7">subluxation</span> is an incomplete dislocation with the contact between the joint surfaces remaining in place (Stedman 2012, 1610). A subluxation commonly seen in children under the age of five is “nursemaid’s elbow.” This injury occurs when a small child is lifted, yanked, or swung by the hand or wrist or falls on an outstretched arm. The injury is a subluxation of the radial head from the annular ligament. The ligament is trapped in the elbow joint and causes acute pain. By manipulating the elbow joint to release the trapped tissue, the subluxation can be corrected, and the pain is immediately relieved.</p>
			<p class="Text">In ICD-10-CM, traumatic dislocations and subluxations are coded to the specific sites of the dislocation within categories S03, S13, S23, S33, S43, S53, S63, S73, S83, and S93 with specific fourth characters to identify the dislocation and subluxation. The main term for dislocation and subluxation is “Dislocation” by site and “Subluxation” by site. Each of these codes requires a seventh character to identify whether the encounter of care for the condition is the initial (A) or a subsequent (D) encounter, or is for a sequela (S).</p>
			<p class="Text">Dislocations may also be described as pathological or recurrent. These are not the same as traumatic dislocations. Codes for these conditions are contained in Chapter 13: Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue, in subcategories M24.3-, Pathological dislocation of joint, not elsewhere classified, and M24.4-, Recurrent dislocation of joint. The main term is dislocation, pathological or dislocation, recurrent, by site.</p>
			<p class="Text">Once a dislocation of a joint has occurred, it takes less effort to produce another dislocation. Only the initial occurrence of the joint dislocation is coded to the injury code. All subsequent dislocations of the same joint are coded as recurrent dislocation.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;A college athlete was brought to the ED with a dislocation of the right shoulder that occurred while he was wrestling at a sporting event. The athlete stated he has had a dislocated shoulder previously. The physician describes the dislocation as “recurrent.” This would be accessed in the Alphabetic Index as Dislocation, recurrent, shoulder, M24.41-</p>
			<p class="Text">The patient’s condition for this episode of care is coded: M24.411, Recurrent dislocation of joint, right shoulder. The M is from the ICD-10-CM chapter on musculoskeletal diseases. It is not coded as a traumatic injury with an acute dislocation code for the shoulder, S43.005A.</p>

Sprains are extremely painful and are accompanied by pain, swelling, and discoloration of the skin over the joint. Treatment includes support, rest, and alternating heat and cold packs for the injury to heal (Mosby 2017, 1273). Whiplash is a specific type of sprain, usually due to a sudden throwing of the head forward and then backward. It is an injury to the supporting structure, ligaments and tendons, of the cervical vertebrae and results in pain and tenderness in the neck (Mosby 2017, 1451). An illustration of the ligaments in the ankle is shown in figure 22A.5a. When an ankle sprain occurs, one or more ligaments in the joint are torn away from the joint structures as illustration in figure 22A.5b.</p>

			<p class="Text">A <span class="CharOverride-7">strain</span> is an overstretching or overexertion of some part of the musculature. Strains usually respond to rest. Strains commonly occur in the musculature of the spine, especially in the neck (cervical strain) and in the low back (lumbar). A strain can be a partial tear in the muscle attached to a bone. The injury usually occurs when there is an unusual force applied to the muscle, for example, in an accident or during an athletic exercise or sport activity. The treatment is usually rest of the site, application of ice, and compression of the area with a wrap or supportive device (Mosby 2017, 1286).</p>
			<p class="Text">In ICD-10-CM, traumatic sprains are coded to the specific site within categories S03, S13, S23, S33, S43, S53, S63, S73, S83, and S93 with specific fourth characters to identify the sprain. The main term is “Sprain” by site. Each of these codes requires a seventh character to identify whether the encounter for care of the condition is the initial (A) or a subsequent (D) encounter, or is for a sequela (S).</p>
			<p class="Text">A strain may also be a traumatic injury. The Alphabetic Index contains the main term “Strain” with subterms for a limited number of sites that direct the coder to the injury chapter for codes such as:</p>

Similarly, under code S06.A, Traumatic brain compression and herniation, there is a “Code first the underlying traumatic brain injury, such as, S06.2, S06.3, S06.5 and S06.6” as traumatic brain injury is likely the cause of traumatic brain compression and herniation. The codes are S06.A0, traumatic brain compression without herniation and S06.A1, traumatic brain compression with herniation. Brain compression and herniation occur when the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and blood vessels are moved or pushed away from the usual position within the skill due to trauma to the brain. Different parts of the brain may herniate and produce different clinical syndromes, signs and symptoms and can be fatal in a short period of time if untreated. The presence or absence of brain compression or herniation is a critical condition to be diagnosed and treated. Non-traumatic compression of the brain may occur is coded to G93.5, Compression of brain in the chapter for nervous system diseases. With code G93.5 there is an Excludes1 note for traumatic compression of brain (S06.A-) to direct the coder to the traumatic code when applicable.</p>
			<p class="Text">An Excludes1 note appears under category S06: “head injury NOS (S09.90).” If the <br />coder finds the diagnosis of “head injury” without the specificity of an intracranial injury, the coder <br />should access the Alphabetic Index under the main term of “injury, head.” The entry of “injury, head” directs the coder to code S09.90. In addition, the Index entry of injury, head, with loss of consciousness provides the code S06.9-. This code identifies the condition as one classified to the intracranial injury category. A loss of consciousness is an indication that an intracranial injury has occurred.</p>
			<p class="Text">Another Index entry for “injury, head, specified type NEC” directs the coder to code S09.8. The diagnosis of “head injury” is a nonspecific description and should only be used if no further detail is provided in the health record documentation. Under code S09.90, Unspecified injury of head, an inclusion term of head injury NOS is provided to explain this is <span id="page605" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 605"></span>the code to use for the diagnosis of head injury when no further information is provided. The coder is reminded with an Excludes1 note that other specified descriptions of a head injury are coded elsewhere, for example, brain injury (S06.9-), head injury with loss of consciousness (S06.9-), and intracranial injury (S06.9-). The Excludes1 note means that category S06 codes are not used with code S09.90 for unspecified head injury.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Open Wound and Crush Injury</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-8">A traumatic <span class="CharOverride-7">open wound</span> is an injury of the soft tissue parts associated with a break or a rupture of the skin (Mosby 2017, 954). Open wounds may be animal bites, avulsions, cuts, lacerations, puncture wounds, and traumatic amputation. In addition, an open wound may be a penetrating wound, which involves the passage of an object through tissue that leaves an entrance and exit, as in the case of a knife or gunshot wound.</p>
			<p class="Text">The seriousness of an open wound depends on its site and extent. If a major vessel or organ is involved, a wound may be life threatening. For example, the rupture of a large artery or vein may cause blood to accumulate in one of the body cavities, which is referred to as hemothorax, hemopericardium, hemoperitoneum, or hemarthrosis, depending on the body cavity involved. The significance of the hemorrhage rests on the volume of the blood loss, the rate of loss, and the site of hemorrhage. Large losses may induce hemorrhagic shock.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-27">Open wounds in ICD-10-CM include such diagnoses as laceration, with and without foreign body; puncture wounds, with or without foreign body; and open bites as well as codes for unspecified open wounds. Animals or humans can cause the bites. The open wounds are classified by site, for example:</p>

			<p class="Text">A <span class="CharOverride-7">crush injury</span> or crushing wound occurs when a body part is caught or squeezed between two heavy objects usually by a high degree of pressure or force (Mosby 2017, 346). Crushing injuries cause bruising, bleeding, compartment syndrome, fractures, lacerations, nerve injuries, and wound infections. Crushing syndrome is a serious condition caused by extensive crushing trauma, characterized by destruction of muscle and bone with hemorrhage and fluid loss resulting in hypovolemic shock, hematuria, renal failure, and coma (Mosby 2017, 346). Less traumatic crush injuries occur in motor vehicle accidents when a body part is caught for a short period of time. For instance, a finger smashed in a car door or legs being trapped for a period of time between metal or heavy objects before the patient can be extricated from a vehicle. Crushing injuries can occur when part or all of an extremity is pulled into and compressed by <span id="page607" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 607"></span>rollers in a machine, such as those found in &#173;industrial plants. Avulsion of the skin and fat or a friction burn of the tissues may result. Abrasion burns are often severe, including third degree. Vessels, nerves, and muscles may be avulsed, and bones may be dislocated or fractured. A common complication is secondary &#173;congestion, which can lead to paralysis and to severe muscle fibrosis and joint stiffness. Muscle compartments may need decompression, and muscles and ligaments may need to be sectioned. Often, the overall circulation of the extremity is of greater concern than definitive management of specific structures. These types of injuries may also be called wringer or compression &#173;injuries in addition to crush, crushed, or crushing injuries.</p>

The same ICD-10-CM coding guidelines apply to both burns and corrosions. Current burns are coded to categories T20–T25 and classified by depth, extent, and by agent or &#173;external cause code. Burns of the eye and internal organs are coded by site, T26–T28, but are not &#173;classified by degree (CDC 2023).</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">A <span class="CharOverride-7">first-degree burn</span> is the least severe and includes damage to the epidermis or outer layer of skin alone. The burn may also be described as superficial. The skin appears pink to red and painful. There is some edema, but no blisters or eschar. Dead skin may peel away two to three days after the burn (Dorland 2012, 261).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">A <span class="CharOverride-7">second-degree burn</span> involves the epidermis and dermis. There is mild to moderate edema, and the burn will blister, but there is no eschar. The burn may also be described as either superficial partial thickness or deep partial thickness. Superficial partial-thickness burns extend into the upper dermal layer and leave the skin pink to red. Because the nerve endings are exposed, any stimulation causes extreme pain. Deep partial-thickness burns extend into the deeper layers of derma, leaving the skin red to pale with moderate edema. Blisters are infrequent, but there will be soft, dry eschar. The patient will experience pain but not as severe as in a superficial partial-thickness burn because some of the nerve endings have been destroyed (Dorland 2012, 262).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-29">A <span class="CharOverride-7">third-degree burn</span> is the most severe and includes all three layers of skin: epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous. A third-degree burn is also known as a full-thickness burn. <br />The skin may appear black, brown, yellow, white, or red. Edema is severe. The <br />burn penetrates the derma and may reach the subcutaneous fat. Pain is minimal because nerve endings are almost completely destroyed. There are no blisters, but there is hard eschar (Dorland 2012, 262).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Burns often exist with other injuries from the same accident. When the reason for the encounter is for treatment of multiple external burns, the site of the burn with the highest degree is coded and sequenced first. Additional codes are used for additional sites with lesser degree burns. When a patient has both an external and internal burn, either type of burn could be coded and sequenced first depending on the circumstances of the admission or encounter. When the patient is admitted with burns and related injuries such as smoke inhalation or organ failure such as respiratory or renal failure, the circumstances of the admission will determine the sequencing of the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">When a patient has burns of varying degrees on one site (a single category between T20–T28), one code is assigned for the highest degree for that site. If burns exist on multiple sites, multiple separate codes are assigned. The category code T30, Burn and corrosion, body region unspecified, should rarely be used as it is too vague and only appropriate if there is no possibility of getting more information to further specify the burn site.</p>
			<p class="Text">Complications can exist with burns. If a burn is not healing, it is coded as an acute burn for each encounter in which it is treated. If the condition is described as necrosis of burned skin, it is equivalent to a nonhealing burn. Burns can also become infected. If a burn site is documented as infected, an additional code for the infection is also assigned.</p>
			<p class="Text">Category T31, Burns classified according to extent of body surface involved, is used as the primary code when the site of the burn is unspecified. This category is used as an additional code with categories T20–T25 when the site is specified. The same rule applies for category T32, Corrosions classified according to extent of body surface involved, which is to be used as an additional code with categories T20–T25 when the site is specified. The use of category T31 can provide valuable data for evaluating burn care and the mortality that unfortunately results from burn injuries. Category T31 will be used as an additional code to report what extent of the body surface is covered and what percent of that body surface is a third-degree <span id="page609" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 609"></span>burn. For example, a patient who has 20 percent of the body surface burned with 10 percent of that surface covered with a third-degree burn would be coded with T31.21. The main term to locate these codes is “burn” or “corrosion,” extent (percentage of body surface) followed by the percentage of third-degree burn (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">Burns can cause long-term problems for patients. A patient may have a condition as the result of a healed burn that requires treatment. The condition the patient has for the long term is called the late effect of the sequela of the burn. The burn is healed, but the secondary condition remains. Common sequelae of burns are scars on the skin or joint contractures. The current condition is coded, such as the scar or contracture, as well as the code for the original burn with the seventh character of S to identify the burn as causing the sequela condition. It is possible for a patient with multiple burns to have a healed burn and a current healing burn existing at the same time, as burns do not heal at the same rate.</p>
			<p class="Text">An external cause of morbidity code should be used with burns or corrosions to identify the cause of the accident as well as the place where it occurred, information about what the patient was doing at the time of the accident, and their work or nonwork status.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-30"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Two patients were being treated in the ED at the same time for burn injuries that occurred within the hour before being brought to the ED. Patient 1 had a second- and third-degree burn of multiple sites on her right hand and wrist as well as a first-degree burn on her right forearm as a result of a kitchen fire at home. Patient 2 had second-degree burns on his right and left forearms as a result of a chemical burn from fire at the factory where he worked.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Superficial Injury</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Superficial injuries such as abrasions or contusions are not coded when associated with more severe injuries (for example, fracture or open wound) of the same site. The following subsections describe the conditions for coding superficial injuries.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Contusion</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-7">Contusions</span> are injuries of the soft tissue. Although the skin is not broken, the small vessels or capillaries are ruptured, and the result is bleeding into the tissue. It may also be referred to as a bruise. When blood becomes trapped in the interstitial spaces, the result is a hematoma (Stedman 2012, 251, 392). ICD-10-CM classifies contusions according to the body site with laterality for right, left, and unspecified site.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient went to the urgent care center after falling off a ladder at home and landing on her knees. After x-rays were taken, the physician concluded that there were no fractures in either leg, and the diagnoses documented were contusions of both knees: S80.01XA, Contusion of right knee and S80.02XA, Contusion of left knee</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Superficial Injury</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-7">Superficial injuries</span> include a variety of less serious conditions such as abrasion, blister, external constriction, superficial foreign body, insect bite, and other superficial bite of a specific location. These injuries are coded according to the body site where they exist and according to the specified laterality of the site with codes for right, left, and unspecified side.</p>
			<p class="Text">The main terms to be used in the Alphabetic Index to locate these injuries are either “Injury, superficial” followed by the body part or by the word for the injury, such as abrasion, contusion, or bite, by site and superficial (CDC 2023). The appropriate seventh character is used with the superficial injury codes to identify whether the episode of care is the initial encounter (A) or a subsequent encounter (D), or for a sequela (S).</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient was seen in the physician’s office complaining of a painful right foot that was scraped when a board fell on her foot. Upon direction of the physician, the medical assistant cleaned the scrapes and denuded skin on the patient’s foot and applied a soft dressing to protect the injured skin. The physician documented the reason for the visit as severe abrasions of the right foot: S90.811A, Abrasion, right foot.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Injury to Blood Vessels, Nerves, and Spinal Cord</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">This subsection describes the conditions for coding injury to blood vessels and the nerves and spinal cord.</p>
			<p class="Text">When a primary injury results in minor damage to peripheral nerves or blood vessels, the coder must assign a code for the primary injury that is sequenced first with additional code(s) for injuries to nerves, spinal cord, or blood vessels. When the primary or major injury is to the blood vessel or nerve (for example, represented by codes from category S15 or category S04), the code for that injury to the blood vessel or nerve is sequenced first.</p>
			<p class="Text">Injuries to blood vessels can be a minor laceration that may also be described as an incomplete transection of a vessel or a superficial laceration of a blood vessel. A blood vessel may <span id="page611" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 611"></span>also have a major laceration that would be a complete transection or traumatic rupture of the blood vessel. Injuries to regions of the spinal cord are classified as to the type of injury, such as complete lesion, central cord syndrome, anterior cord syndrome, Brown-Séquard syndrome, or other incomplete lesions. Injuries to nerves are classified by the specific nerve involved.</p>
			<p class="Text">Some examples of Alphabetic Index entries for locating injuries to blood vessels, nerves, and spinal cord are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">Injury, blood vessel, by site, such as abdomen, laceration (S35.91)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Injury, aorta, abdominal (S35.00)</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Each of these injuries requires a seventh character to identify the initial encounter of care (A), subsequent encounter of care (D), or sequel episode (S). Instructional notes appear throughout the chapter with categories for injuries to blood vessels, nerves, and spinal cord. Examples of notes include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top ParaOverride-20">Code first any associated intracranial injury</li>

			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-3">A traumatic amputation is another type of injury classified to codes within Chapter 19 of ICD-10-CM. A <span class="CharOverride-7">traumatic amputation</span> is the loss of a body part as the result of an accident or injury (Stedman 2012, 80). The most common sites of a traumatic removal of a limb or part of a limb are the finger, hand, toe, and foot. An amputation not identified as partial or complete is coded as a complete amputation. The categories for amputations of upper and lower extremities are as follows:</p>

			</table>
			<p class="Text">Each category requires the use of the appropriate seventh character to identify whether the treatment for the traumatic amputation is the initial encounter (A), a subsequent encounter (D), or is a sequela of the amputation (S). The codes for the traumatic amputations identify whether the right or left extremity is affected with other specificity as to the level of the amputation, such as between hip and knee, at knee level, between knee and ankle, and such.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient was brought to the ED by ambulance from the factory where he works after he suffered a partial amputation of his right index and middle fingers when his hand was caught in a machine. The patient was taken to surgery for repair of his two fingers and discharged from the hospital in two days. The final diagnosis for the patient was partial metacarpophalangeal amputation of index and middle fingers of right hand: S68.120A, Partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of right index finger; S68.122A, Partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of right middle finger.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Effects of Foreign Body Entering through Natural Orifice (T15–T19)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-8">The condition created in the body as a result of a foreign body entering through a natural orifice is coded with categories T15–T19. These codes do not include foreign body accidentally left in operative wound (T81.5-), foreign body in penetrating wound (see open wound by body region), residual foreign body in soft tissue (M79.5), or splinter without open wound (see foreign body, superficial by site such as finger, foot, knee, and so on).</p>
			<p class="Text">Categories for the coding of foreign body are body systems, for example, respiratory tract, with fourth, fifth, and sixth character codes to identify the specific body part where the foreign body was located. The sixth character identifies a complication of the presence of the foreign body, <br />for example, causing asphyxiation, compression, or other injury when this can occur based on the anatomic site.</p>
			<p class="Text">Foreign objects often are found in various body openings in the pediatric population. Children sometimes put small items in their nose or ears or swallow small items, such as coins <span id="page613" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 613"></span>or marbles. Foreign bodies also can lodge in the larynx, bronchi, or esophagus, usually during eating. Foreign bodies in the larynx may produce hoarseness, coughing, and gagging, and partially obstruct the airway, causing stridor. A grasping forceps through a direct laryngoscope can remove foreign bodies from the larynx.</p>
			<p class="Text">Foreign bodies in the bronchi usually produce an initial episode of coughing, followed by an asymptomatic period before obstructive and inflammatory symptoms occur. Foreign bodies <br />are removed from the bronchi through a bronchoscope. Foreign bodies in the esophagus <br />produce the immediate symptoms of coughing and gagging, with the sensation of something being “stuck in the throat,” as well as causing difficulty in swallowing. Foreign bodies in the esophagus can be removed through an esophagoscope. Intraocular foreign bodies require removal by an ophthalmic surgeon.</p>
			<p class="Text">These codes can be found in the Alphabetic Index by referencing the main term “Foreign body” and the various subterms such as by site or “entering through orifice.” When the <br />foreign body is associated with a laceration, this is located in the Index under “foreign body, in, &#173;laceration—see Laceration, by site, with foreign body.” A foreign body accidentally left following a procedure is coded according to the type of procedure that was performed. The codes in categories T15–T19 require an appropriate seventh character to be added to indicate whether the episode of care was the initial encounter (A) or a subsequent encounter (D), or a sequela of the foreign body event (S). Categories T15–T19 include an instructional note for coders to use an additional code, if known, for the foreign body entering into or through a natural orifice (W44.-).</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-34"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;A 55-year-old male patient came to the ED complaining of “food stuck in his throat.” The patient was eating at a restaurant with family members and took a big bite of steak and felt it stick in his “throat.” He tried to dislodge the meat himself in the restroom by forcing himself to vomit but the object did not move. The patient stated he could not even swallow water after this occurred. The ED physician called the gastroenterologist to examine the patient who decided the patient needed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to remove the substance. The gastroenterologist documented in his EGD report that the patient had an abrasion injury in his esophagus due to lodged meat. The physician could push the substance into the patient’s stomach where it would be eliminated from the body naturally. The diagnosis for this patient would be coded as T18.128A, Food in esophagus causing other injury, initial encounter; W44.53XA, Food entering into or through a natural orifice.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Frostbite</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-7">Frostbite</span> damages skin and subcutaneous tissue when the skin is exposed to low environmental temperatures (Dorland 2012, 746). The damage can occur when body parts are exposed to cold temperatures for a prolonged period of time or extreme cold for a short period of time. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and diabetes are more likely to develop frostbite when exposed to the cold. Symptoms of frostbite include varying sensations at the site, including the feeling of pins and needles followed by numbness, as well as a lack of sensation when the area is touched. The skin may appear hard and pale, and after the area thaws, the body surface becomes red and painful. Severe cases of frostbite will have blisters and damage to tendons, muscles, nerves, and bone. If frostbite affects blood vessels, the damage is likely to be permanent with possible gangrene developing that requires amputation of the affected site. <span id="page614" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 614"></span>If the blood vessels are not involved, the patient most likely will have a complete recovery. While frostbite can occur when any part of the body is exposed to cold temperatures, the most common sites of frostbite are the hands, fingers, feet, toes, nose, and ears.</p>
			<p class="Text">The injury of frostbite is classified in ICD-10-CM according to whether it is superficial frostbite (T33) or frostbite with tissue necrosis (T34). A superficial frostbite involves only the epidermis and upper epidermis with partial-thickness skin loss (Dorland 2012, 746). The severe type of frostbite involves tissue necrosis (may be documented as fourth-degree frostbite) that extends through a part of the body where the frostbite occurred and where gangrene develops and the site must be amputated (Dorland 2012, 746). Sites include parts of the body that are more likely to be exposed to low environmental temperatures, for example, head and face, ear, nose, neck, thorax, abdominal wall, arm, wrist, hand, finger, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, foot, and toe. The codes include the laterality of the site as well as an unspecified side. The categories for frostbite require the appropriate seventh character for the initial encounter (A) or a subsequent encounter (D), or for a sequela (S).</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-7">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;A 60-year-old male patient was brought to the ED by fire ambulance called by homeless shelter workers who found the homeless man exposed to very cold temperatures that night and noticed his fingers looked “frozen.” The ED physician determined the patient had superficial frostbite of both hands and placed the patient in observation overnight and requested a social work consultation to help the patient find appropriate lodging. The diagnoses for the patient would be coded: T33.521A, Superficial frostbite of right hand, initial encounter, and T33.522A, Superficial frostbite of left hand, initial encounter.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">ICD-10-PCS Coding for Procedures Related to the Treatment of Injuries</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Two of the more commonly coded procedures related to the injuries is the coding of fracture treatment and the repair of skin lacerations. The following sections describe the root operations that are used for these types of injuries. Fracture treatment depends on the type of fracture and surgical and non-surgical treatment that is appropriate depending on the type of fracture. The repair of the skin lacerations will depend on the location and the depth of the injury.</p>
			<span id="page615" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 615"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Fracture Treatment</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The root operations typically used for coding fracture treatment are Reposition, Insertion, and Immobilization.</p>
			<p class="Text">The definition of <span class="CharOverride-7">Reposition</span> is moving to its normal location, or other suitable location, all or a portion of a body part (CMS 2023). The body part is moved from an abnormal location or from a normal location where it is not functioning properly. The object of the procedure is to restore or establish normal function. The most common use of the root operation Reposition is to code a fracture or dislocation reduction. In a fracture reduction, the physician moves the bone or bone fragments back into their proper location. For a dislocation reposition, the physician moves a dislocated joint back into the correct position for articulation or movement of the joint. The terminology used by the physician will likely be “reduction,” and the coder needs to translate that term to the ICD-10-PCS root operation Reposition. The approach for a Reposition procedure may be External or Closed, Percutaneous, Percutaneous Endoscopic, or Open.</p>
			<p class="Text">The definition of <span class="CharOverride-7">Insertion</span> is putting in a nonbiological device that monitors, assists, performs, or prevents a physiological function but does not physically take the place of a body part (CMS 2023). In this procedure, the sole objective is to put in a device without performing any other procedure. If the insertion of a device is a component of another procedure, the device is included in the device character for that procedure. Examples of an insertion procedure is putting in a pin to hold a nondisplaced fracture to allow it to heal properly or putting in a bone growth stimulator to promote healing of a fracture that is slow to heal.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">The definition of <span class="CharOverride-7">Immobilization</span> is limiting or preventing motion of a body region (CMS 2023). An example of an immobilization procedure is the placement of cast or splint to promote healing of a nondisplaced fracture or a dislocation. The body region for an immobilization procedure for musculoskeletal procedures includes upper and lower extremity, upper and lower arm, upper and lower leg, hand, thumb, finger, foot, and toe. The approach is always External. The device used for an immobilization may be a Splint, Cast, Brace, or another device. These devices are premade, out of the box items, and do not require extensive adjustment or fitting. There is no qualifier used for immobilization procedures.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">The reduction or manipulation of a displaced fracture is coded in ICD-10-PCS to the root operation Reposition. The application of a cast or splint with a fracture reduction is not coded separately. A nondisplaced fracture does not require a repositioning. Any treatment of a nondisplaced fracture is coded to the procedure performed. For example, if a nondisplaced fracture <br />is treated by putting in a fixation pin, the root operation is Insertion. If the nondisplaced fracture only requires the application of a cast or splint, the root operation is Immobilization.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-34">Coding Repair of Lacerations</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-7">Repair</span> is defined in ICD-10-PCS as a root operation to restore, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomical structure and function. Repair is the root operation that is used if no other root operation applies. Repair is essentially the not elsewhere classifiable (NEC) root operation (CMS 2023). Repair procedures include a variety of procedures such as suturing <br />lacerations of the skin or internal organs and herniorrhaphy that does not include mesh. If a fixation device is used to repair a bone or joint, it is included in the Repair root operation. If a Repair is performed on overlapping layers of the musculoskeletal system, the body part specifying the deepest layer is coded. The repair of skin lacerations is coded to 0HQ with the body part being skin of a specific location, such as skin of the scalp, face, right upper arm, left lower arm, right upper leg, left lower leg, right foot, and such. The approach is always external as the site can be accessed directly.

			<p class="Review-Exe-NL-First"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span></span>&#9;Superficial foreign body, right middle finger, initial encounter in emergency department</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">2.</span></span>&#9;This patient is seen for increased pain in her ankle. She has a displaced trimalleolar fracture of the left ankle. During this subsequent evaluation for her fracture care, she was found to have a nonunion of her left trimalleolar fracture.</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">3.</span></span>&#9;Fracture of right tibia, lower end, physeal, Salter-Harris, type II, initial fracture care</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">4.</span></span>&#9;The patient is a complete paraplegic due to a traumatic L2 vertebral fracture five years ago. At this time, she is not experiencing any new problems.</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">5.</span></span>&#9;This is a follow-up visit for the healing of the patient’s partial amputation of the right index finger through the metacarpophalangeal joint.</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">6.</span></span>&#9;Crushing injury of the left hand sustained in an industrial accident when the patient’s hand was caught in a piece of machinery. The crushing injury also produced an open fracture of the base of the first metacarpal bone of the left hand at the same time. This is the emergency department initial encounter for care of the injury.</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">7.</span></span>&#9;The patient was seen in the emergency department for the initial encounter. The patient was playing a high school football game and received a hard tackle by an opponent and complained of acute severe pain in his right side. Examination and imaging prove there was a moderate laceration of the right kidney.</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium CharOverride-2">8.</span></span>&#9;The patient is seen in her physician’s office complaining of acute ankle pain. Based on her history of twisting her ankle while going down stairs during a recent move from one apartment to another and the physical examination performed, the physician diagnosed the patient with an acute sprain of the talofibular ligament of the right ankle during this initial care visit.</p>
			<p class="Review-Exe-NL"><span class="Review-NL"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">9.</span></span>&#9;The patient came to the physician’s office for follow-up during the healing phase of the injury to the left index finger, specifically a laceration of the left index finger that was cut with a knife when the patient was preparing dinner one week ago. The physician also diagnosed a laceration to a digital nerve of the left index finger that occurred at the same time as the skin laceration. Both injuries are healing satisfactorily.</p>
