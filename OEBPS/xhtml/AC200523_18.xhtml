			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">In ICD-10-CM Chapter 15, terminology is descriptive of what obstetric condition is intended to be represented by the obstetric code. Codes for elective (legal or therapeutic) abortions are classified with the abortion codes in Chapter 15. Complications of induced termination of pregnancy are found in category O04. In comparison, the elective abortion without complication code Z33.2 is included in Chapter 21 of ICD-10-CM, which includes factors influencing health status and contact with health services. Chapter 15 also identifies the trimester of pregnancy in which the condition occurred at the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-character levels. Figure 18.1 shows a detailed diagram of the female reproductive system including the peritoneal and pelvic cavities.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM requires the use of a seventh character to identify the fetus to which certain complication codes apply. One of the seventh characters is assigned to certain codes in <br />ICD-10-CM Chapter 15 as directed in the tabular list. The seventh character of 0 is used for a single gestation or when a multiple gestation exists but the fetus cannot be specified as the cause of the maternal condition described by the code. The seventh characters of 1 through 9 are for patients with multiple gestations and used to identify the fetus that is responsible for the condition identified by the code. For example, code O64.1XX2 would be used to state that fetus 2 has caused the obstructed labor due to breech presentation in a pregnant patient <br /><span id="page493" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 493"></span>with multiple gestations. In summary, the seventh character of 0 is used for all pregnancies with <br />a single gestation. The seventh character of 0 may be used when the patient is pregnant <br />with twins, triplets, or the like but which fetus is responsible for the condition cannot be identified. If the pregnant woman has a condition that can be attributed to one of the multiple </span><span class="CharOverride-1">fetuses she is carrying, the seventh characters of 1 through 9 are used to identify fetus 1, 2, </span><span class="CharOverride-1">3 </span><span class="CharOverride-1">or similarly fetus A, B, or C, as identified by the attending physician as responsible for the </span><span class="CharOverride-1">condition.</span></p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a. General Rules for Obstetric Cases</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.1. Codes from Chapter 15 and sequencing <br />priority:</span> Obstetric cases require codes from Chapter 15, codes in the range O00–O9A, Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium. Chapter 15 codes have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions. Should the provider document that the pregnancy is incidental to the encounter, then code Z33.1, Pregnant state, incidental, should be used in place of any Chapter 15 codes. It is the provider’s responsibility to state that the condition being treated is not affecting the pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.2. Chapter 15 codes used only on the maternal <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-5">record:</span> Chapter 15 codes are to be used only on the maternal record, never on the record of the newborn.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.3. Final character for trimester:</span> The majority of codes in Chapter 15 have a final character indicating the trimester of pregnancy. The timeframes for the trimesters are indicated at the beginning of the chapter. If trimester is not a component of a code it is because the condition always occurs in a specific trimester, or the concept of trimester of pregnancy is not applicable. Certain codes have characters for only certain trimesters because the condition does not occur in all trimesters, but it may occur in more than just one.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Assignment of the final character for trimester should be based on the provider’s documentation of the trimester (or number of weeks) for the current admission/encounter. This applies to the assignment of trimester for pre-existing conditions as well as those that develop during or are due to the pregnancy. The provider’s documentation of the number of weeks may be used to assign the appropriate code identifying the trimester.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Whenever delivery occurs during the current admission, and there is an “in childbirth” option for the obstetric complication being coded, the “in childbirth” code should be assigned. When the classification does not provide an obstetric code with an “in childbirth” option, it is appropriate to assign a code describing the current trimester.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.4. Selection of trimester for inpatient admis</span><span class="CharOverride-5">sions </span><span class="CharOverride-5">that encompass more than one trimester:</span> In instances when a patient is admitted to a hospital for complications of pregnancy during one trimester and remains in the hospital into a subsequent trimester, the trimester character for the antepartum complication code should be assigned on the basis of the trimester when the complication developed, not the trimester of the discharge. If the condition developed prior to <span id="page496" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 496"></span>the current admission/encounter or represents a pre-existing condition, the trimester character for the trimester at the time of the admission/encounter should be assigned.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.5. Unspecified trimester:</span> Each category that includes codes for trimester has a code for “unspecified trimester.” <br />The “unspecified trimester” code should rarely be used, such as when the documentation in the record is insufficient to determine the trimester and it is not possible to obtain clarification.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.6. Seventh (7th) character for Fetus Identification:</span> Where applicable, a 7th character is to be assigned for certain <br />categories (O31, O32, O33.3 - O33.6, O35, O36, O40, O41, <br />O60.1, O60.2, O64, and O69) to identify the fetus for which the complication code applies.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Assign 7th character “0”:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="CG_BL ParaOverride-10">For single gestations</li>
				<li class="CG_BL ParaOverride-10">When the documentation in the record is insufficient to <br />determine the fetus affected and it is not possible <br />to obtain clarification.</li>
				<li class="CG_BL ParaOverride-10">When it is not possible to clinically determine which fetus is affected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.a.7. Completed weeks of gestation:</span> In ICD-10-CM, “completed” weeks of gestation refers to full weeks. For example, if the provider documents gestation at 39 weeks and 6 days, the code for 39 weeks of gestation should be assigned, as the patient has not yet reached 40 completed weeks.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.b. Selection of OB Principal or First-listed Diagnosis</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.b.1. Routine outpatient prenatal visits</span>: For routine outpatient prenatal visits when no complications are present, a code from category Z34, Encounter for supervision of normal pregnancy, should be used as the first-listed diagnosis. These codes should not be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.b.2. Supervision of high-risk pregnancy:</span> Codes from category O09, Supervision of high-risk pregnancy, are intended for use only during the prenatal period. For &#173;complications during the labor and delivery episode as a result of a high-risk pregnancy, assign the applicable complication codes from Chapter 15. If there are no complications during the labor or delivery <br />episode, assign O80, Encounter for full-term uncomplicated delivery.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">For routine prenatal outpatient visits for patients with &#173;high-risk <br />pregnancies, a code from category O09, Supervision of &#173;high-risk pregnancy, should be used as the first-listed diagnosis. Secondary Chapter 15 codes may be used in conjunction with these codes if appropriate.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.b.3. Episodes when no delivery occurs:</span> In &#173;episodes when no delivery occurs, the principal diagnosis should correspond to the principal complication of the &#173;pregnancy which <span id="page497" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 497"></span>necessitated the encounter. Should more than one complication exist, all of which are treated or monitored, any of the complication codes may be sequenced first.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">Guideline I.C.15.b.4. When a delivery occurs:</span> When an obstetric patient is admitted and delivers during that admission, the &#173;condition that prompted the admission should be sequenced as the principal diagnosis. If multiple conditions prompted the admission, sequence the one most related to the delivery as the principal diagnosis. A code for any complication of the &#173;delivery should be assigned as an additional diagnosis.

The main term “Delivery (childbirth) (labor)” has several subterms beneath it in alphabetic order. The subterms with “cesarean (for)” describe the reason(s) for the cesarean delivery. Such terms are breech presentation, failed induction of labor, malposition or malpresentation, planned, occurring after 37 completed weeks of gestation but before 39 completed weeks gestation due to (spontaneous) onset of labor, previous cesarean delivery, prolonged labor, transverse presentation, and the like. Another important subterm under <br />delivery is “complicated, by” that includes a long list of conditions that can complicate a delivery, <br />such as cord around neck, delayed following rupture of membranes, hemorrhage, laceration of perineum, obstructed labor, placenta problems, prolonged labor, uterine inertia, and the like.

However, it is not a common occurrence for the physician to state the pregnancy is unaffected, no matter how minor the injury or condition. For this reason, a code from Chapter 15 in ICD-10-CM is more frequently used than Z33.1. Code Z33.1 is indexed under the main term “Pregnancy, incidental finding” in the Alphabetic Index. There is an Excludes1 note under code Z33.1 to remind the coder that complications of pregnancy (codes O00–O9A) cannot be used with code Z33.1 as the codes for the pregnancy complications should be used when present and the code for pregnant state is omitted.</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A category Z34 code is assigned for supervision of a pregnancy. Code Z34.0, Supervision of normal first pregnancy, uses a fifth character identifying the first, second, third, or unspecified trimester. Z34.8 is a similar code, but it is for supervision of other normal pregnancy than the first pregnancy. The trimester of the pregnancy is identified by the fifth character. Supervision of normal subsequent pregnancies is generally used in outpatient settings and for routine prenatal visits.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">When a complication of the pregnancy is present, the code for that condition is assigned rather than a code from category Z34. These codes are not used with any other pregnancy code in Chapter 15 of ICD-10-CM because the Z34 code indicates the patient is pregnant and healthy, whereas the Chapter 15 codes indicate an obstetrical problem or condition exists. Codes in category Z34 are indexed under “Pregnancy, supervision (of) (for)” in the Index to Diseases and Injuries.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Z3A Weeks of Gestation</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">A code from category Z3A is for use only on the maternal record. The Alphabetic Index entries used to locate this code is “pregnancy, weeks of gestation.” The Z3A code is used to indicate the </span><span class="CharOverride-4">weeks of gestation</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> of the pregnancy. The gestation period is the duration of the pregnancy. The weeks of gestation indicate the length of the pregnancy measured in completed weeks. Normal pregnancies are intrauterine and the duration of the pregnancy from conception to delivery is approximately 266 days from the time of fertilization of the oocyte until birth or 288 days from the last normal menstrual period until birth (Dorland 2012, 1509). The Z3A code for the weeks of gestation is used in addition to a code from Chapter 15 to identify the condition or complication of the pregnancy or childbirth. The “code first” note that appears under category Z3A states code first complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, O09–O9A. The ICD-10-CM chapter specific coding guidelines for Chapter 21 (Z00–99), part (11) state the category Z3A codes are not assigned for pregnancies with abortive outcome (O00–O08), elective terminations of pregnancy, nor for conditions that occur during the puerperium. The fifth-character level of the code identifies the individual specific week of gestation starting at 8 weeks through 42 weeks of gestation with other codes for shorter or longer periods of gestation. Table 18.1 is an example of some of the relevant codes.</span></p>

An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy arising from implantation of the ovum outside the uterine cavity. About 98 percent of ectopic pregnancies are tubal (occurring in the fallopian tube). Other sites include the peritoneum or abdominal viscera, ovary, or cervix (Sivalingam et al. 2011). Figure 18.2 is a diagram of the locations of implantation for ectopic pregnancies within the fallopian tube.</span></p>

The 5th character for the ectopic pregnancy codes identify is the ectopic pregnancy is present without or with an intrauterine pregnancy. The 6th character identifies if the tubal or ovarian pregnancy is present on the right side or the left side. An unspecified code O00.90–O00.91 is used for the rare occasions when the site of the ectopic pregnancy is not specified. A “use additional code” note appears under the category heading to use a code from category O08, Complication following ectopic and molar pregnancy, to identify any associated complication. Complications that may occur with an ectopic pregnancy are infection, hemorrhage, embolism, shock, renal failure, metabolic disorders, damage to pelvic organs, or other specified conditions.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">A </span><span class="CharOverride-4">missed abortion</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> occurs when the fetus has died before completion of 20 weeks’ gestation, with retention in the uterus. The death is indicated by cessation of growth, hardening of the uterus, loss of size of the uterus, and absence of fetal heart tones after they have been heard on previous examinations (Dorland 2012, 4). The ICD-10-CM Tabular includes a description of a missed abortion under code O02.1 as early fetal death before completion of 20 weeks of gestation with retention of dead fetus (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A woman with a missed abortion may develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a bleeding disorder that occurs when the blood is lacking the elements needed for blood clotting (Dorland 2012, 376) and progressive hypofibrinogenemia or the lack of fibrinogen in the blood that produces coagulation of blood (Stedman 2012, 629). Massive bleeding may occur when delivery is finally completed in the patient with DIC. During this time, symptoms of pregnancy disappear. For the patient without complications like DIC, once the missed abortion treatment is complete, a brownish vaginal discharge may occur.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The diagnosis of </span><span class="CharOverride-4">spontaneous abortion</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is defined as the expulsion or extraction from the uterus of all or part of the products of conception: an embryo or a nonviable fetus weighing less than 500 grams (Puscheck 2023). The spontaneous abortion occurs without a medical or surgical intervention to cause it. When a fetus’s weight cannot be determined, an estimated gestation of less than 20 completed weeks is considered an abortion in ICD-10-CM. The procedure also known as abortion is more precisely described as a dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation, or aspiration curettage.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Coders frequently confuse the clinical condition of missed abortion with spontaneous abortion. A missed abortion is a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy that has been retained within <br />the uterus without spontaneous abortion. Typically, no symptoms exist beside amenorrhea, and the <br />patient finds out that the pregnancy stopped developing earlier when a fetal heartbeat is not observed or heard at the appropriate time (Puscheck 2023). In contrast to a spontaneous abortion, no products of conception, fetal parts, or tissue is expelled from the uterus when the patient has a missed abortion. All of the uterine contents remain in the uterus. When a spontaneous abortion occurs, the woman experiences one or more of the classic symptoms of a pregnancy loss, such as uterine contractions, uterine hemorrhage, dilation of the cervix, and presentation or expulsion of all or part of the products of conception.</span></p>

For example, if the physician documents the woman has having “advanced maternal age” but no other complications of the pregnancy and has a completely normal delivery, the principal diagnosis code of O80, Encounter for full-term uncomplicated delivery is assigned.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Code O80 is used as a single diagnosis code and is not to be used with any other code from Chapter 15. An additional code to indicate the outcome of delivery, Z37.0, Single live birth, must be used with code O80. Every woman who has a delivery must have a code from the appropriate procedure classification. For example, an ICD-10-PCS procedure code for the vaginal or cesarean delivery would be used for an inpatient admission, and a CPT procedure code would be used for an outpatient healthcare encounter or for a provider’s professional fee billing. Even if the woman delivers the infant at home or on the way to the hospital and expels the placenta after being admitted to the hospital, the delivery of the placenta is coded 10E0XZZ, Delivery of <br />products of conception. ICD-10-PCS considers both the infant and the placenta as products <br />of conception. A diagnosis code can capture the fact the baby was born outside the hospital.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Encounter for Cesarean Delivery Without Indication (O82)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Code O82 is used when the pregnant female has a cesarean delivery without the indication or the reason for the cesarean delivery documented in the health records. Usually when there is no indication for the cesarean delivery documented in the record, the physician should be queried for an explanation or reason for the cesarean delivery. This code is not expected to be used for all encounters for a cesarean delivery. There is always a reason for a cesarean delivery. The diagnosis code O82 means there was no stated reason in the record for the cesarean delivery to be performed. When the reason for the surgical delivery is documented in the health record, the condition must be coded instead of code O82. When the documentation in the record is not clear as to the reason for the cesarean delivery, the physician should be asked for clarification of the obstetrical condition that prompted this type of delivery. When code O82 is used, an additional code Z37.0 is used to indicate the outcome of delivery.</span></p>

Pre-eclampsia is the presence of hypertension and proteinuria with or without coexisting systematic abnormalities involving the kidneys, liver, or blood in a pregnant woman. Eclampsia, which is considered a complication of severe pre-eclampsia, is commonly defined as new onset of grand mal seizure activity and/or unexplained coma during pregnancy or postpartum in a woman with signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia. It typically occurs during or after the 20th week of gestation or in the postpartum period. Ten percent of all pregnancies are complicated by hypertension. Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia account for about half of these cases worldwide and have been recognized and described for years despite the general lack of understanding of the disease (Ross 2022). Alphabetic Index entries of “pregnancy, complicated, by, eclampsia or edema or pre-eclampsia or eclampsia” are used to assign these diagnosis codes.
