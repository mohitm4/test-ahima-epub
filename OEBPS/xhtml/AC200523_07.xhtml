			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The category Disorders of Thyroid Gland contains the frequently coded conditions of hypothyroidism, nontoxic goiter, thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis. For the thyroid conditions that are related to drugs such as hypothyroidism or thyroiditis, there are notes to “code first” poisoning due to drug or toxin and use additional code for adverse effect. For acute thyroiditis, another note reminds the coder to use additional code (B95–B97) to identify the infectious agent.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The thyroid gland is located in the neck in front of the trachea. It consists of two lobes that are connected by an isthmus or space. The thyroid gland produces two hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), that regulate metabolic functions in the body including growth and development, body temperature, how fast the heart beats, and how the body burns calories. Four parathyroid glands are located to the dorsal area of the thyroid lobes. The parathyroid hormone helps to maintain blood calcium, normal neuromuscular function, blood clotting, and cell membrane permeability (NLM 2023a; Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-16">Hypothyroidism</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hypothyroidism is the condition caused by decreased production of the thyroid hormones. This can be an acquired condition caused by surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid, or hypothyroidism can be caused by medications to treat hyperthyroidism or various other <br />congenital or autoimmune factors. Examples of these conditions are described with code <br />E03.0, congenital hypothyroidism with diffuse goiter, and E03.2, hypothyroidism due to </span><span class="CharOverride-1">medicaments and other exogenous substances. There is a “code first” note and a “use addi</span><span class="CharOverride-1">tional <span id="page197" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 197"></span>c</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ode” note following E03.2 to remind the coder to identify the drug that is involved with pro</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ducing the hypothyroidism (NLM 2023b; Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Goiter</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland that produces a prominent swelling in the neck. The enlargement may be associated with normal levels of thyroid hormones or may be present with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The condition is called a diffuse nontoxic goiter or a simple goiter. The gland may be cystic or fibrous with single or multiple nodules present. Treatment is usually the administration of antithyroid or thyroid hormones depending on the patient’s thyroid function. Surgery is rarely done for diffuse nontoxic or simple goiters except when there is evidence of tracheal compression or obstruction of the thoracic outlet (Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A toxic goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid with numerous nodules and excessive thyroid hormone production. It occurs most frequently in elderly individuals and produces signs of thyrotoxicosis such as nervousness, tremor, weakness, irritability, fatigue, and weight loss, as anorexia is common. Heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia are produced by a toxic goiter or thyrotoxicosis. Management of this condition may be difficult, but treatment is usually antithyroid drugs in combination with beta-blocker heart medications to normalize the thyroid function. After the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment with radioactive iodine may be required (Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Thyrotoxicosis</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the state of thyroid hormone excess and is not the same as hyperthyroidism, that is, the result of excessive thyroid function. Hyperthyroidism is usually caused by Graves’ disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenomas. In hyperthyroidism, the gland is excreting greater than normal amounts of thyroid hormone. This produces accelerated metabolic processes in the body. Symptoms include nervousness, fatigue, heat intolerance, palpitations, constant hunger with weight loss, tremors, and exophthalmos. Treatment usually prescribed is antithyroid drugs with radioactive iodine for certain scenarios. Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to serious heart failure. Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland may be necessary (Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Thyroiditis</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid that may be caused by viral or bacterial infections, certain medications, genetics, or autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Two of the more common types of thyroiditis are Hashimoto’s disease and postpartum thyroiditis. Inflammation of the thyroid after giving birth, postpartum thyroiditis, is often underdiagnosed because the symptoms may be considered the “baby blues” that may follow a delivery. Postpartum women may feel very tired and moody. Within a month of delivery, the patient may have signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism with excess </span><span class="CharOverride-1">thyroid hormones in the bloodstream, but several months later, symptoms of hypothyroidism are exhibited when the hormones decrease and the thyroid begins to recover. The condition is more likely to occur in women who have a personal or family history of thyroid disorders or have chronic viral hepatitis. Treatment depends on the patient’s symptoms and the stage of the disease.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hashimoto’s disease is also known as autoimmune thyroiditis or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In this condition, the immune system produces antibodies that interfere with the thyroid’s ability to make thyroid hormone. This causes the thyroid levels to be too low, and hypothyroidism is produced. An underactive thyroid causes the body’s metabolic functions to slow <span id="page198" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 198"></span>down, including maintaining heart rate and producing energy from food. Hashimoto’s disease (named after a Japanese surgeon) is closely related to Graves’ disease, another autoimmune disease of the thyroid. Symptoms of Hashimoto’s disease are usually a goiter and a feeling of fullness in the throat making it difficult to swallow. The patient also has fatigue, weight gain, pale coloring in the face with fullness, slower heart rate, and various other symptoms that could be attributed to many other disorders. Replacement therapy with thyroid hormone is the usual treatment (Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-19">Diabetes Mellitus (E08–E13)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-8">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a metabolic disease in which the pancreas does not produce insulin normally. The cause of diabetes mellitus can be attributed to both hereditary and nonhereditary factors, such as obesity, surgical removal of the pancreas, or the action of certain drugs. When the pancreas fails to produce insulin, glucose (sugar) is not broken down to be used and stored by the body’s cells. As a result, too much sugar accumulates in the blood, causing hyperglycemia and excess glucose in the urine (glycosuria). Saturating the blood and urine with glucose draws water out of the body, causing dehydration and thirst. Other symptoms include excessive hunger, marked weakness, and weight loss. Treatment may consist of insulin regulation by either insulin injection or oral antidiabetic agents, along with physical activity and a healthy diet. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems in the heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, gums, and teeth. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), 29.1 million Americans, or 9.3 percent of the population, have diabetes according to statistics collected in 2015. Approximately 1.25 million American children have type 1 diabetes, as the incidence of type 2 diabetes is much greater. Americans aged 65 years and older have a high prevalence of diabetes, with 25.9 percent, or 11.8 million, of seniors diagnosed and undiagnosed (ADA 2023a).</span></p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-8">Type 1 diabetes</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and was previously known as juvenile diabetes but can appear at any age. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin. According to the American Diabetes Association, only 5 percent of people with diabetes have this form of the disease. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include frequent urination, unusual thirst, extreme hunger, unusual weight loss, and extreme fatigue and irritability (ADA 2023b).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The most common type of diabetes is </span><span class="CharOverride-8">type 2 diabetes</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. The body does not produce enough insulin, or the cells ignore the insulin or do not use insulin well. A patient who is older, is </span><span class="CharOverride-1">obese, has a family history of diabetes, and does not exercise is at higher risk of type 2 diabe</span><span class="CharOverride-1">tes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly. Symptoms include the same symptoms type 1 diabetic patients experience in addition to frequent infections, blurred vision, cuts and bruises that are slow to heal, and tingling and numbness in the hands and feet. However, some people do not notice symptoms at all (ADA 2023c).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">There are five categories for diabetes mellitus in ICD-10-CM. The diabetes mellitus codes reflect manifestations and complications of the disease by using the fourth or fifth characters. ICD-10-CM classifies inadequately controlled, out of control, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus by reporting diabetes mellitus, by type, with hyperglycemia.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Disorders of Other Endocrine Glands (E20–E35)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The endocrine system is made up of the endocrine glands that secrete hormones. There are eight major </span><span class="CharOverride-8">endocrine glands</span><span class="CharOverride-1">: pituitary, pineal, thyroid, thymus, adrenal, pancreas, testes in males, and ovaries in females. These glands are scattered throughout the body but are considered one body system because of their similar functions and mechanisms of influence as well as important interrelationships.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Codes for disorders of the parathyroid gland, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thymus gland, as well as testicular and ovarian dysfunction are included here. Some of the commonly coded conditions in this block of codes are Cushing’s syndrome, Addison’s disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, premature menopause, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, and carcinoid syndrome. For conditions related to the use of medications, notes are included to “use additional code” for adverse effect to identify the drug or drugs that are responsible for the gland’s dysfunction.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Cushing’s syndrome is a metabolic disorder resulting from the excessive production of or exposure to the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is produced by the adrenal gland, also known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is a pituitary tumor. Other causes include taking a synthetic hormone drug that is used to treat an inflammatory disease elsewhere in the body. Fortunately, Cushing’s syndrome is rare. The treatment depends on the cause of the excessive hormone. Medications may be prescribed to lower the cortisol levels or surgery may be required to remove the pituitary gland that is increasing the secretion of ACTH (Mosby 2022; NLM 2023d; NLM 2023e).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Addison’s disease, also known as primary adrenocortical insufficiency, is a serious meta</span><span class="CharOverride-1">bolic </span><span class="CharOverride-1">condition caused by complete or partial failure of the adrenocortical function in the body. The </span><span class="CharOverride-1">adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, simply do not make enough of the hormone cortisol </span><span class="CharOverride-1">and androgens. The causes may be an autoimmune process where the body’s immune system </span><span class="CharOverride-1">attacks its own tissue, damaging the adrenal glands or causing tubercular or fungal infection or a hem</span><span class="CharOverride-1">orrhage in the adrenal gland. If left untreated, the condition can be life threatening. Treatment includes replacement therapy with glucocorticoid and mineral corticoid drugs and careful regulation of fluids and diet intake (Mosby 2022; NLM 2023f; NLM 2023g).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Polycystic ovarian syndrome or polycystic ovary disease is an endocrine disorder character</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ized by anovulation, amenorrhea, hirsutism, and infertility. The cause of the disease is unknown but suspected to be the result of various factors working together, including insulin resistance, </span><span class="CharOverride-1">increased levels of the hormone androgen, and irregular menstrual cycles. Androgens are ste</span><span class="CharOverride-1">roid hormones produced by the adrenal glands or the ovaries. Women with polycystic ovary disease also tend to have endometrial hyperplasia where the lining of the uterus becomes too thick. This condition is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Treatment depends on the woman’s symptoms, whether she wants to become pregnant, and other health conditions that coexist.

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-8">Malnutrition</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. There are a number of causes of malnutrition. It may result from inadequate or unbalanced diet, problems with digestion or absorption, and certain medical conditions. Malnutrition can occur if a person does not eat enough food. Starvation is a form of malnutrition. A person may develop malnutrition if there is a lack of a single vitamin in the diet. In some cases, malnutrition is very mild and causes no symptoms. However, sometimes it can be so severe that the damage done to the body is permanent (NLM 2023e, 2023g).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM contains a code for </span><span class="CharOverride-8">kwashiorkor</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, a severe malnutrition with nutritional edema with dyspigmentation of the skin and hair. This condition is most common in areas where there is famine, limited food supply, and low levels of education of how to eat a proper diet. This disease is more common in very poor countries. It often occurs during a drought or other natural disaster, or during political unrest. These conditions are responsible for a lack of food, which leads to malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is very rare in children in the United States. When kwashiorkor does occur in the United States, it is usually a sign of child abuse and severe neglect (NLM 2023h).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-8">Marasmus</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a severe deficiency of calories and protein. It tends to develop in infants and very young children. It typically results in weight loss and dehydration. Breast-feeding usually protects against marasmus (Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM contains a limited number of malnutrition codes in this chapter. Codes are included for severe malnutrition, moderate and mild degree protein–calorie malnutrition, and malnutrition unspecified. The documentation required to best describe the type of malnutrition would include the degree of malnutrition (first, mild, moderate, second, severe, third) or the type of protein–calorie or protein–energy malnutrition (mild, moderate, or severe).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Other Nutritional Deficiencies (E50–E64)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Codes in this section classify a variety of vitamin and other nutrient deficiencies. For example, the conditions included here are vitamin A, thiamine, B group, and D and K deficiencies. Other conditions include dietary deficiencies of calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium, and other specified nutrient elements. Also in this block of codes is category E64, Sequelae of malnutrition and other nutritional deficiencies. This category is used to indicate conditions in categories E43, E44, E46, and E50–63 as the cause of sequelae, which are themselves classified elsewhere. These are the late effects of diseases classifiable to the above categories if the disease itself is no longer present. A “code first” note to code the condition resulting from (sequela) of malnutrition and other nutritional deficiencies is included here.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Both overweight and obesity mean a person’s weight is greater than what is considered healthy for his or her height. A person described as obese means the person has too much body fat. A person described as overweight means the person weighs too much. Both terms means the person’s weight is greater than what is considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity occurs when a person eats more calories than the person burns in activities or exercise. Each person has a balance their body needs for calories in and calories out. Factors that also affect weight include a person’s genetic composition, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. Obesity increases the person’s risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers (NLM 2023i). The title of this section of codes includes “hyperalimentation,” which means overfeeding or the ingestion of an amount of nutrients that exceeds the demands of the appetite (Mosby 2022).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Body mass index (BMI) is used as a screening tool for overweight or obesity. BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The BMI measurement is a screening tool but is not a diagnostic indicator of body fatness or health of an individual. Appropriate health assessments are necessary to evaluate an individual’s status and risks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2023), the following BMI ranges indicate underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese status:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-1">If the BMI is less than 18.5, it indicates the person is within the underweight range.</span></li>

This condition is classified to E86.0. Common in infants and elderly people, severe dehydration can occur with vomiting, excessive heat and sweating, diarrhea, or lack of food or fluid intake. Blood volume may be maintained despite dehydration, with fluid being pulled from other tissues. Conversely, hypovolemia may occur without dehydration when “third spacing” of fluids occurs, for example, with significant edema or ascites. </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Hypovolemia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is an abnormally low circulating blood volume and is classified to E86.1. Blood loss may be due to internal bleeding from the intestine or stomach, external bleeding from an injury, or loss of blood volume and body fluid associated with diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, or burns. If hypovolemia is severe, hypovolemic shock can occur with symptoms such as rapid or weak pulse, feeling faint, pale skin, cool or moist skin, rapid breathing, anxiety, overall weakness, and low blood pressure. Emergency medical attention must be sought. Given that the nature of these two conditions and their respective treatments are different, coding of hypovolemia is different from dehydration (NLM 2023j).</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The more common procedures on the endocrine glands are Excision, Resection, and Destruc</span><span class="CharOverride-1">tion. The surgical removal of all of a body part (</span><span class="CharOverride-8">Resection</span><span class="CharOverride-1">), part of a body part (</span><span class="CharOverride-8">Excision</span><span class="CharOverride-1">), or the physical eradication (</span><span class="CharOverride-8">Destruction</span><span class="CharOverride-1">) of all or a portion of </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the endocrine glands are coded based on the body part involved. Biopsy procedures are per</span><span class="CharOverride-1">formed on endocrine glands by excision or by fine needle aspiration that could be either an excision of tissue or drainage of fluid or gases.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Laterality is used to identify the body parts within the endocrine system, for example, left, right, and bilateral adrenal glands as well as left and right inferior and superior parathyroid glands. Of particular importance in coding thyroid procedures, the coder must note that the lobes of the thyroid gland are individual body parts. If the physician describes the procedure as a thyroidectomy of the left lobe, the procedure is coded as a Resection of the thyroid gland lobe, left, as PCS identifies this site as a body part. Coding the thyroidectomy of the left lobe as an Excision would be incorrect as an Excision is cutting out or off a portion of a body part.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The coder should review the following ICD-10-PCS guidelines for a complete description of coding biopsy, excision, and resection procedures.</span></p>
			<p class="T ParaOverride-35"><span class="CharOverride-16">B3.4a Biopsy Procedures</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18">Biopsy procedures are coded using the root operations Excision, Extraction, or Drainage and the qualifier Diagnostic. Examples: Fine needle aspiration biopsy of lung is coded to the root operation Drainage with the qualifier Diagnostic. Biopsy of bone marrow is coded to the root operation Extraction with the qualifier Diagnostic. Lymph node sampling for biopsy is coded to the root operation Excision with the qualifier Diagnostic.</p>
			<p class="CG_Head"><span class="CharOverride-3">B3.4b Biopsy followed by more definitive treatment</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18">If a diagnostic Excision, Extraction, or Drainage procedure (biopsy) is followed by a more definitive procedure, such as Destruction, Excision, or Resection at the same procedure site, both the biopsy and the more definitive treatment is coded. Example: Biopsy of breast followed by partial mastectomy at the same procedure site, both the biopsy and the partial mastectomy procedure are coded.</p>
			<p class="CG_Head"><span class="CharOverride-3">B3.8 Excision vs. Resection</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18">PCS contains specific body parts for anatomical subdivisions of&#160;a body part, such as lobes of the lungs or liver and regions of <br />the intestine. Resection of the specific body part is coded whenever all of the body part is cut out and off, rather than coding Excision of a less specific body part. Example: Left upper <span id="page210" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 210"></span>lung lobectomy is coded to Resection of Upper Lung Lobe, Left rather than Excision of Lung, Left.</p>
			<p class="CG_Head"><span class="CharOverride-3">B4.1a General Guidelines for Body Part</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">If a procedure is performed on a portion of a body part that does not have a separate body part value, code the body part value corresponding to the whole body part. Example: A procedure performed on the alveolar process of the mandible is coded to the mandible body part (CMS 2023).</p>

Stereotactic radiosurgery is classified in </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the Radiation Therapy section of ICD-10-PCS. The main term to use in the Index to locate these procedures is “Stereotactic radiosurgery” with subterms of gamma beam, other photon, and particulate with </span><span class="CharOverride-1">additional entries of the body part involved. </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a form of radi</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ation therapy that focuses high-powered x-rays on a small area of the body.
