			<p class="Text">Code titles in the respiratory system chapter of ICD-10-CM reflect current terminology used in pulmonary medicine. For example, asthma codes include the descriptors of mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. Emphysema codes include descriptors for panlobular and centrilobular emphysema. Influenza and acute bronchitis codes include the manifestations of these diseases in one code.</p>
			<p class="Text">For example, ICD-10-CM category J43, Emphysema, contains codes with panlobular emphysema and centrilobular emphysema in the titles. ICD-10-CM category J45, Asthma, classifies asthma as mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent.</p>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM provides specificity in the respiratory system chapter codes. For example, ICD-10-CM has individual codes for acute recurrent sinusitis for each sinus. Subcategory J10.8, Influenza due to other identified influenza virus with other manifestations, has been expanded to reflect the manifestations of the influenza.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-5">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes for&#160;ICD-10-CM Chapter 10</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">At the beginning of Chapter 10, the following instructional guideline appears: “When a respiratory condition is described as occurring in more than one site and is not specifically indexed, it should be classified to the lower anatomic site” (CDC 2023). For example, tracheobronchitis is classified to bronchitis in J40, Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic.</p>
			<p class="Text">An additional instructional note also appears at the beginning of Chapter 10 that instructs the coding professional to use an additional code, where applicable, to identify</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span id="page351" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 351"></span>exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z77.22),</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">exposure to tobacco smoke in the perinatal period (P96.81),</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">history of tobacco dependence (Z87.891),</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z57.31),</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">tobacco dependence (F17.-), or</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">tobacco use (Z72.0).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6">Since these instructional notes appear at the beginning of the chapter, they should be followed when assigning any code from this chapter.</p>
			<p class="Text">Some of the codes in Chapter 10 include notes indicating that an additional code should be assigned or an associated condition should be sequenced first. The following are examples of the instructional notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-7">Use additional code to identify the infectious agent</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Use additional code to identify the virus</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Code first any associated lung abscess</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Code first the underlying disease</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-8">Use additional code to identify other conditions such as tobacco use or exposure</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6">In the Tabular, there is a note under category J44 to code also the type of asthma, if applicable (J45.-). There is also an Excludes2 note under category J45 for asthma with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By definition, when an Excludes2 note appears under a code, it is acceptable to use both the code and the excluded code together if the patient has both conditions at the same time.</p>
			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 10 in the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 10 of ICD-10-CM, which appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or on the CDC website (CDC 2023) or in appendix F of this textbook.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-2">Guideline I.C.10.a. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD] and Asthma</span></p>
			<p class="CG_list1"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span>&#9;Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchitis and asthma</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent">The codes in categories J44 and J45 distinguish between uncomplicated cases and those in acute exacerbation. An acute exacerbation is a worsening or a decompensation of a chronic condition. An acute exacerbation is not equivalent to an infection superimposed on a chronic condition, though an exacerbation may be triggered by an infection.</p>

			<p class="CG_list1"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span>&#9;Acute respiratory failure as principal diagnosis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">A code from subcategory J96.0, Acute respiratory failure, or subcategory J96.2, Acute and chronic respiratory failure, may be assigned as a principal diagnosis when it is the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission to the hospital, and the selection is supported by the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List. However, chapter-specific coding guidelines (such as obstetrics, poisoning, HIV, newborn) that provide sequencing direction take precedence.</p>
			<p class="CG_list1"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">2.</span>&#9;Acute respiratory failure as secondary diagnosis</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">Respiratory failure may be listed as a secondary diagnosis if it occurs after admission, or if it is present on admission, but does not meet the definition of principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_list1"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">3.</span>&#9;Sequencing of acute respiratory failure and another acute condition</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">When a patient is admitted with respiratory failure and another acute condition, (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, aspiration pneumonia), the principal diagnosis will not be the same in every situation. This applies whether the other acute condition is a respiratory or nonrespiratory condition. Selection of the principal diagnosis will be dependent on the circumstances of admission. If both the respiratory failure and the other acute condition are equally responsible for occasioning the admission to the hospital, and there are no chapter-specific sequencing rules, the guideline regarding two or more diagnoses that equally meet the definition for principal diagnosis (Section II, C.) may be applied in these situations.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent">If the documentation is not clear as to whether acute respiratory failure and another condition are equally responsible for occasioning the admission, query the provider for clarification.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-2">Guideline I.C.10.c. Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Code only confirmed cases of influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses (category J09), and due to other identified influenza virus (category J10). This is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline Section II, H. (Uncertain Diagnosis).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">In this context, “confirmation” does not require documentation of positive laboratory testing specific for avian or other novel<span id="page353" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 353"></span> influenza A or other identified influenza virus. However, coding should be based on the provider’s diagnostic statement that the patient has avian influenza, or other novel influenza A, for category J09, or has another particular identified strain of influenza, such as H1N1 or H3N2, but not identified as novel or variant, for category J10.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">If the provider records “suspected” or “possible” or “probable” avian influenza, or novel influenza, or other identified influenza, then the appropriate influenza code from category J11, Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus, should be assigned. A code from category J09, Influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses, should not be assigned nor should a code from category J10, Influenza due to other identified influenza virus.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-2">Guideline I.C.10.d. Ventilator associated Pneumonia</span></p>
			<p class="CG_list1 ParaOverride-9"><span class="cbl _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;Documentation of Ventilator associated Pneumonia</span></p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">As with all procedural or postprocedural complications, code assignment is based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship between the condition and the procedure.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">Code J95.851, Ventilator associated pneumonia, should be assigned only when the provider has documented ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). An additional code to identify the organism (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, code B96.5) should also be assigned. Do not assign an additional code from categories J12-J18 to identify the type of pneumonia.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">Code J95.851 should not be assigned for cases where the patient has pneumonia and is on a mechanical ventilator and the provider has not specifically stated that the pneumonia is ventilator-associated pneumonia. If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a pneumonia that is a complication attributable to the mechanical ventilator, query the provider.</p>
			<p class="CG_list1 ParaOverride-10"><span class="cbl CharOverride-3">2.</span>&#9;<span class="CharOverride-2">Ventilator associated Pneumonia Develops after Admission</span></p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-no-indent ParaOverride-6">A patient may be admitted with one type of pneumonia (e.g., code J13, Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumonia) and subsequently develop VAP. In this instance, the principal diagnosis would be the appropriate code from categories J12–J18 for the pneumonia diagnosed at the time of admission. Code J95.851, Ventilator associated pneumonia, would be assigned as an additional diagnosis when the provider has also documented the presence of ventilator associated pneumonia.</p>
			<span id="page354" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 354"></span>
			<p class="CG_list1 ParaOverride-11"><span class="cbl CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.10.e. Vaping-related disorders</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">For patients presenting with condition(s) related to vaping, assign code U07.0, Vaping-related disorder, as the principal diagnosis. For lung injury due to vaping, assign only code U07.0. Assign additional codes for other manifestations, such as acute respiratory failure (subcategory J96.0-) or pneumonitis (J68.0).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Associated respiratory signs and symptoms due to vaping, such as cough, shortness of breath, etc., are not coded separately, when a definitive diagnosis has been established. However, it would be appropriate to code separately any gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Coding Diseases of the Respiratory System <br />in ICD-10-CM Chapter 10</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Chapter 10 of ICD-10-CM contains codes for a wide variety of pulmonary conditions, ranging from acute upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, influenza, as well as diseases of the lower respiratory tract including chronic lung diseases and diseases acquired from exposure to external substances. Intraoperative and postprocedural complications are also available to be coded in this chapter. Figure 13.1 is a diagram of the respiratory track including the trachea, bronchi, and lungs.</p>

			<p class="Text">One three-character code, J00, is used to identify the classification of acute nasopharyngitis or the common cold, which may also be described as acute rhinitis. An Excludes1 listing of conditions under this category reminds the coder what conditions cannot be coded with acute nasopharyngitis. However, the Excludes2 note identifies conditions that can exist concurrently with acute nasopharyngitis and can be coded, for example, chronic pharyngitis and chronic rhinitis.</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">Avian influenza virus is a highly contagious disease of wild and domesticated birds caused by <span class="CharOverride-1">avian influenza virus</span> (Dorland 2012, 937). Avian influenza disease has not been reported in humans in the United States. It has however been reported in United States poultry, but not transmitted to humans as of yet.

			<p class="Text-flush">Novel H1N1 influenza virus was a flu virus of swine origin that first caused illness in Mexico and the United States in 2009. It was thought to spread the same way that regular seasonal influenza viruses are spread, mainly through coughing and sneezing by people who are sick with the virus. It produced flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, headaches, body aches, fatigue, and chills. During 2009 to 2010, more than 70 countries had reported cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection, and there were ongoing community level outbreaks of novel H1N1 in multiple parts of the world. For this reason, it was classified as a pandemic by the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2009). By 2010, the pandemic was considered over, and the H1N1 virus that caused that pandemic is now a regular human flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide (CDC 2009).</p>

			<p class="Text">Code J40, Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic, is assigned when the specific type of bronchitis is not documented in the health record. If the physician documented only “bronchitis,” this is the code assigned. However, it must be noted that code J40 is intended to reflect a chronic lung disease. When the primary care physician in her office or the emergency department physician writes “bronchitis” as a final diagnosis for an outpatient visit for a child, adolescent, or young adult, the physician probably means the patient has an acute type of bronchitis. However, the physician must be asked to clarify the type of bronchitis to assign a different code; no assumptions should be made based on the age of the patient.</p>

Numerous external agents cause lung disease; many of these are long-term conditions and may be incurable. Many of these conditions may be referred to as occupational lung disorders because the individuals acquire the conditions as part of their occupation or employment. For example, what is commonly referred to as “Black Lung Disease” is a hazard of working in coal mines and inhaling carbon particles and is classified in ICD-10-CM with code J60 for Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a disease of the lungs that become inflamed by breathing in foreign substances, such as dust, mold, and chemicals or substances known as antigens. Most people who breathe in these substances do not develop hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Inhaling mold, hay, straw, and grain over the long term can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonia. That is why hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be called “farmer’s lung” as farm workers often work in dusty environments and inhale the antigens of mold, hay, stray, and grain that damage their lungs (NHLBI 2022b).</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">The commonly coded conditions in this section of codes include acute and chronic respiratory failure and acute bronchospasm.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Respiratory Failure (J96)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-6">Respiratory failure</span> is the inability of the respiratory system to supply adequate oxygen to maintain proper metabolism or to eliminate carbon dioxide (CO<span class="CharOverride-12">2</span>). Respiratory failure is the consequence of another illness, such as acute and chronic heart and lung diseases, sepsis, trauma, or poisonings. The patient’s respiratory system is unable to maintain the necessary levels of oxygen for life and is unable to expel the accumulating carbon dioxide that damages tissues and organs (Dorland 2012, 678). ICD-10-CM classifies different forms of respiratory failure to the following codes in category J96, Respiratory failure, not elsewhere classified:</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-13">J96.0,&#9;Acute respiratory failure</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid">&#9;J96.00,&#9;Acute respiratory failure, unspecified whether with hypoxia or <br />hypercapnia</p>

			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-28">&#9;J96.92,&#9;Respiratory failure, unspecified, with hypercapnia</p>
			<p class="Text">The code for respiratory failure is assigned when documentation in the health record supports its use. It may be due to, or associated with, other respiratory conditions such as pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, or COPD. Respiratory failure also may be due to, or associated with, nonrespiratory conditions such as myasthenia gravis, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or CVA. Arterial blood gases may be useful in diagnosing respiratory failure; however, normal values may vary from person to person depending on individual health status. Coders should not assume the condition of respiratory failure exists based solely on laboratory and radiology test findings.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding and Sequencing of Acute Respiratory Failure</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The coding and sequencing of acute respiratory failure presents many challenges to both the new and the experienced clinical coder. Various coding rules and guidelines must be considered.</p>
			<p class="Text">Acute respiratory failure, codes J96.00–J96.02, may be assigned as a principal or secondary diagnosis depending on the circumstances of the inpatient admission. Chapter-specific coding guidelines (obstetrics, poisoning, HIV, newborn) provide specific sequencing direction. <span id="page370" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 370"></span>Respiratory failure may be listed as a principal diagnosis. In addition, if respiratory failure occurs after admission, it may be listed as a secondary diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Text">When a patient is admitted in acute respiratory failure with another acute condition, the principal diagnosis will not be the same in every situation. There is not one respiratory failure coding rule. This is true whether or not the other acute condition is a respiratory or nonrespiratory condition. Selection of the principal diagnosis will depend on the circumstances of the admission. If both the respiratory failure and the other acute condition are equally responsible for the patient’s admission to the hospital, and there are no chapter-specific sequencing rules, the guideline regarding two or more diagnoses that equally meet the definition for principal diagnosis may be applied. If the documentation is not clear as to whether the acute respiratory failure and another condition are equally responsible for occasioning the admission, the physician must be asked for clarification.</p>

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-2">Closed Endoscopic Biopsy</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-6">Endoscopy</span> is a procedure that involves a visual inspection of any cavity of the body or an organ by the means of an endoscope. An endoscope is an instrument for examining the interior of a body cavity or organ (Dorland 2012, 620). Unlike most other medical imaging devices, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ. An endoscope can consist of a rigid or flexible tube with a light delivery system to illuminate the organ or object under inspection. There is a lens attached to the tube transmitting the image from the lens to the viewer through an eyepiece. There is an additional tube to allow the entry of medical instruments. In the respiratory tract, the two types of endoscopies performed are via the nose (rhinoscopy) and via the mouth (bronchoscopy) to the lower respiratory tract.</p>
			<p class="Text">A closed endoscopic biopsy of the respiratory system is the excision of tissue for diagnostic purposes through a bronchoscope in the respiratory system. By ICD-10-PCS definition, a Biopsy is an excision or cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part. For the Respiratory system, Excision procedures are coded according to table 13.7 (CMS 2023).</p>

			<p class="Text">When coding closed endoscopic biopsies, the specific site where the excision is made, including the laterality, is required:</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-15">0BBK4ZX,&#9;Thoracoscopic lung biopsy, right</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">0BB78ZX,&#9;Closed [bronchoscopic] biopsy of left main bronchus</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">0BBG8ZX,&#9;Closed [bronchoscopic] biopsy of lung, upper lung lobe (left)</p>
			<p class="IL_Last">0BBN4ZX,&#9;Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy, right</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Endoscopic Procedures in the Respiratory System</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Because many lesions in the respiratory tract can be removed by endoscopic means that do not require opening the chest, ICD-10-PCS provides codes for this type of procedure. For example:</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-15">0BB68ZZ,&#9;Bronchoscopic excision of lesion or tissue of bronchus, lower lobe bronchus, right</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">0BBG8ZZ,&#9;Bronchoscopic excision of lesion or tissue of lung, upper lung lobe, left</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-28">0BBG4ZZ,&#9;Thoracoscopic lobectomy of lung, upper lung lobe, left</p>
			<p class="Text">The difference in the examples above is the type of endoscopy performed: bronchoscopy or thoracoscopy. The bronchoscopy is performed with the Via Natural or Artificial Opening Endoscopic approach (through the mouth). The thoracoscopy is performed through a Percutaneous Endoscopic approach.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Mechanical Ventilation</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-6">Mechanical ventilation</span> is clinically indicated for patients with apnea, acute respiratory &#173;failure, and impending acute respiratory failure. Invasive mechanical ventilation pumps air into the patient’s lungs even when there is no attempt by the patient to breathe on his or her own (Braunwald et al. 2001, 1526).</p>
			<p class="Text">Mechanical ventilation is coded to the Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance section in ICD-10-PCS. Mechanical ventilation is provided via an invasive interface, such as endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Endotracheal intubation requires the placement of the tracheal tube, either orally or nasally. Assign code 0BH17EZ, Insertion of endotracheal airway into trachea, via natural or artificial opening, or code 0BH18EZ, Insertion of endotracheal airway into trachea, via natural or artificial opening endoscopic.</p>
			<p class="Text">On the other hand, insertion of an endotracheal tube in order to maintain an airway in patients who are unconscious or unable to breathe on their own is the central objective of the procedure. Therefore, insertion of an endotracheal tube as an end in itself is coded to the root operation Insertion and the device Endotracheal Airway (CMS 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">The ICD-10-PCS procedure codes for mechanical ventilation and related procedures are as follows:</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-15">5A1935Z,&#9;Mechanical ventilation for less than 24 consecutive hours</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">5A1945Z,&#9;Mechanical ventilation for 24 to 96 consecutive hours</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">5A1955Z,&#9;Mechanical ventilation for greater than 96 consecutive hours</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">0B110F4,&#9;Creation of tracheostomy for use with mechanical ventilation</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">0BH17EZ,&#9;Insertion of endotracheal airway into trachea, via natural or artificial opening</p>
			<p class="IL_Last ParaOverride-14">0BH18EZ,&#9;Insertion of endotracheal airway into trachea, via natural or artificial opening <br />endoscopic</p>
