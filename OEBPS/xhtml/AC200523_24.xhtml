			<p class="Text">Codes included in Chapter 21: Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (Z00–Z99), represent reasons for encounters. Z codes are diagnosis codes. If a procedure is performed, a corresponding procedure code must be used with the Z code that identifies the reason for the encounter. Z codes are provided for encounters when circumstances other than a disease or injury are recorded in the health record as the diagnosis—the problem or reason for the encounter.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient is a 50-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for chemotherapy for carcinoma of the lower-outer quadrant of her right breast. The intravenous chemotherapy was given through a central vein by percutaneous approach. The patient was discharged the second day. The codes for this admission are as follows:</p>
			<p class="XM_IL">Z51.11, Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy</p>
			<p class="XM_IL">C50.511, Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of right female breast</p>
			<p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-7">3E04305, Administration through central vein, percutaneous approach, antineoplastic, other antineoplastic (Introduction of substance, vein, central, antineoplastic)</p>
			<p class="Text">Some categories in Chapter 21 have titles to clearly describe the situations the code will classify. For example, the description for Z08 is “Encounter for follow-up examination after completed treatment for malignant neoplasm” to identify the reason for the visit for <span id="page669" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 669"></span>the patient who is being seen after having completed treatment for cancer. Another example of a clear description of the reason for the patient’s examination is subcategory Z00.0, Encounter for general adult medical examination. Code Z00.00 identifies a general adult medical examination without abnormal findings, and code Z00.01 identifies a general adult medical examination with abnormal findings. These codes distinguish between the encounter when a patient is found to be completely healthy and when an abnormal finding has been identified in the patient who presented for a medical examination. Under code Z00.01 is a “use additional code” note to identify the abnormal finding so that the patient’s situation can be fully described.</p>
			<p class="Text">However, some conditions are not specifically identified. In ICD-10-CM there is a category, Z16, to represent infection with antimicrobial drug–resistant microorganisms. For example, if a patient had an infection that did not respond to treatment by the usual penicillin medication, code Z16.11 would identify the resistance of the condition to this antimicrobial drug. Another example of a nonspecific situation is code Z23, Encounter for immunization. This code does not identify the types of immunizations that were administered.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes for ICD-10-CM Chapter 21</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Instructional notes are available in the different categories to explain how codes should be assigned. For example, under category Z01, Encounter for other special examination without complaint, suspected or reported diagnosis, is the following note: “Codes from category Z01 represent the reason for the encounter. A separate procedure code is required to identify any examinations or procedures performed” (CDC 2023). Also, under category Z85, Personal history of malignant neoplasm, is the following note: “Code first any follow-up examination after treatment of malignant neoplasm (Z08)” (CDC 2023).</p>

			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 21 in the <span class="CharOverride-2">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 21 of ICD-10-CM that appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or on the CDC website (CDC 2023) or in appendix F.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Chapter 21: Factors influencing health status and contact with health services (Z00–Z99):</span> Note: The chapter specific guidelines provide additional information about the use of Z codes for specified encounters.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.a. Use of Z Codes in Any Healthcare Setting:</span> Z codes are for use in any healthcare setting. Z codes may be used as either a first-listed (principal diagnosis code in the inpatient setting) or secondary code, depending on the circumstances of the encounter. Certain Z codes may only be used as first-listed or principal diagnosis.</p>
			<span id="page670" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 670"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.b. Z Codes Indicate a Reason for an Encounter or Provide Additional Information about a Patient Encounter:</span> Z codes are not procedure codes. A corresponding procedure code must accompany a Z code to describe any procedure performed.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c. Categories of Z Codes</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.1. Contact/Exposure:</span> Category Z20 indicates contact with, and suspected exposure to, communicable diseases. These codes are for patients who are suspected to have been exposed to a disease by close personal contact with an infected individual or are in an area where a disease is epidemic.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Category Z77, Other contact with and (suspected) exposures hazardous to health, indicates contact with and suspected exposures hazardous to health.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Contact/exposure codes may be used as a first-listed code to explain an encounter for testing, or, more commonly, as a secondary code to identify a potential risk.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.2. Inoculations and vaccinations:</span> Code Z23 is for encounters for inoculations and vaccinations. It indicates that a patient is being seen to receive a prophylactic inoculation against a disease. Procedure codes are required to identify the actual administration of the injection and the type(s) of immunizations given. Code Z23 may be used as a secondary code if the inoculation is given as a routine part of preventive health care, such as a well-baby visit.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.3. Status:</span> Status codes indicate that a patient is either a carrier of a disease or has the sequelae or residual of a past disease or condition. This includes such things as the presence of prosthetic or mechanical devices resulting from past treatment. A status code is informative, because the status may affect the course of treatment and its outcome. A status code is distinct from a history code. The history code indicates that the patient no longer has the condition.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">A status code should not be used with a diagnosis code from one of the body system chapters, if the diagnosis code includes the information provided by the status code.&#160;For&#160;example, code&#160;Z94.1, Heart transplant status, should not be used with a code from subcategory T86.2, Complications of heart transplant. The status code does not provide additional information. The complication code indicates that the patient is a heart transplant patient.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">For encounters for weaning from a mechanical ventilator, assign a code from subcategory J96.1, Chronic respiratory failure, followed by code Z99.11, Dependence on respirator [ventilator] status.</p>
			<span id="page671" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 671"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The status Z codes/categories are:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z14, Genetic carrier</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Genetic carrier status indicates that a person carries a gene, associated with a particular disease, which may be passed to offspring who may develop that disease. The person does not have the disease and is not at risk of developing the disease.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z15, Genetic susceptibility to disease</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Genetic susceptibility indicates that a person has a gene that increases the risk of that person developing the disease.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Codes from category Z15 should not be used as principal or first-listed codes. If the patient has the condition to which he/she is susceptible, and that condition is the reason for the encounter, the code for the current condition should be sequenced first.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">If the patient is being seen for follow-up after completed treatment for this condition, and the condition no longer exists, a follow-up code should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate personal history and genetic susceptibility codes. If the purpose of the encounter is genetic counseling associated with procreative management, code Z31.5, Encounter for genetic counseling, should be assigned as the first-listed code, followed by a code from category Z15. Additional codes should be assigned for any applicable family or personal history.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z16, Resistance to antimicrobial drugs</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">This code indicates that a patient has a condition that is resistant to antimicrobial drug treatment. Sequence the infection code first.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z17, Estrogen receptor status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z18, Retained foreign body fragments</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z19, Hormone sensitivity malignancy status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z21, Asymptomatic HIV infection status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">This code indicates that a patient has tested positive for HIV but has manifested no signs or symptoms of the disease.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z22, Carrier of infectious disease</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Carrier status indicates that a person harbors the specific organisms of a disease without manifest symptoms and is capable of transmitting the infection.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z28.3, Underimmunization status</p>
			<span id="page672" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 672"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub"><span class="CharOverride-4">See Section I.B.14. for underimmunization documentation by clinicians other than the patient’s provider.</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z33.1, Pregnant state, incidental</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">This code is a secondary code only for use when the pregnancy is in no way complicating the reason for visit. Otherwise, a code from the obstetric chapter is required.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z66, Do not resuscitate</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">This code may be used when it is documented by the provider that a patient is on do not resuscitate status at any time during the stay.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z67, Blood type</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z68, Body mass index (BMI)</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">BMI codes should only be assigned when there is an  associated, reportable diagnosis (such as obesity). Do not assign BMI codes during pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8"><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">See Section I.B.14 for BMI documentation by clinicians other than the patient’s provider</span>.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z74.01, Bed confinement status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z76.82, Awaiting organ transplant status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z78, Other specified health status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Code Z78.1, Physical restraint status, may be used when it is documented by the provider that a patient has been put in restraints during the current encounter. Please note that this code should not be reported when it is documented by the provider that a patient is temporarily restrained during a procedure.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z79, Long-term (current) drug therapy</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">Codes from this category indicate a patient’s continuous use of a prescribed drug (including such things as aspirin therapy) for the long-term treatment of a condition or for prophylactic use. It is not for use for patients who have addictions to drugs. This subcategory is not for use of medications for detoxification or maintenance programs to prevent withdrawal symptoms (e.g., methadone maintenance for opiate dependence). Assign the appropriate code for the drug use, abuse, or dependence instead.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">Assign a code from Z79 if the patient is receiving a medication for an extended period as a prophylactic measure (such as for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis) or as treatment of a chronic condition (such as arthritis) or a disease <span id="page673" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 673"></span>requiring a lengthy course of treatment (such as cancer). Do not assign a code from category Z79 for medication being administered for a brief period of time to treat an acute illness or injury (such as a course of antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z88, Allergy status to drugs, medicaments and biological substances</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">Except: Z88.9, Allergy status to unspecified drugs, medicaments and biological substances status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z89, Acquired absence of limb</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z90, Acquired absence of organs, not elsewhere classified</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z91.0-, Allergy status, other than to drugs and biological substances</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z92.82, Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to a current facility</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">Assign code Z92.82, Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to current facility, as a secondary diagnosis when a patient is received by transfer into a facility and documentation indicates they were administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the last 24 hours prior to admission to the current facility.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">This guideline applies even if the patient is still receiving the tPA at the time they are received into the current facility.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-8">The appropriate code for the condition for which the tPA was administered (such as cerebrovascular disease or myocardial infarction) should be assigned first.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Code Z92.82 is only applicable to the receiving facility record and not to the transferring facility record.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z93, Artificial opening status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z94, Transplanted organ and tissue status</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z95, Presence of cardiac and vascular implants and grafts</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z96, Presence of other functional implants</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z97, Presence of other devices</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z98, Other postprocedural states</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Assign code Z98.85, Transplanted organ removal status, to indicate that a transplanted organ has been previously removed. This code should not be assigned for the encounter in which the transplanted organ is removed. The &#173;complication <span id="page674" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 674"></span>necessitating removal of the transplant organ should be assigned for that encounter.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub"><span class="CharOverride-4">See Section I.C19. for information on the coding of organ transplant complications</span>.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z99, Dependence on enabling machines and devices, not elsewhere classified</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub"><span class="CharOverride-3">Note:</span> Categories Z89–Z90 and Z93–Z99 are for use only if there are no complications or malfunctions of the organ or tissue replaced, the amputation site or the equipment on which the patient is dependent.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.4. History (of):</span> There are two types of history Z codes, personal and family. Personal history codes explain a patient’s past medical condition that no longer exists and is not receiving any treatment, but that has the potential for recurrence, and therefore may require continued monitoring.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Family history codes are for use when a patient has a family member(s) who has had a particular disease that causes the patient to be at higher risk of also contracting the disease.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Personal history codes may be used in conjunction with follow-up codes and family history codes may be used in conjunction with screening codes to explain the need for a test or procedure. History codes are also acceptable on any medical record regardless of the reason for visit. A history of an illness, even if no longer present, is important information that may alter the type of treatment ordered.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The reason for the encounter (for example, screening or counseling) should be sequenced first and the appropriate personal and/or family history code(s) should be assigned as additional diagnos(es).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The history Z code categories are:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z80, Family history of primary malignant neoplasm</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z81, Family history of mental and behavioral disorders</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z82, Family history of certain disabilities and chronic diseases (leading to disablement)</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.5. Screening:</span> Screening is the testing for disease or disease precursors in seemingly well individuals so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those who test positive for the disease (e.g., screening mammogram).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The testing of a person to rule out or confirm a suspected diagnosis because the patient has some sign or symptom is a diagnostic examination, not a screening. In these cases, the sign or symptom is used to explain the reason for the test.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">A screening code may be a first-listed code if the reason for the visit is specifically the screening exam. It may also be used as an additional code if the screening is done during an office visit for other health problems. A screening code is not necessary if the screening is inherent to a routine examination, such as a pap smear done during a routine pelvic examination.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Should a condition be discovered during the screening then the code for the condition may be assigned as an additional diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The Z code indicates that a screening exam is planned. A procedure code is required to confirm that the screening was performed.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The screening Z codes/categories:</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.6. Observation:</span> There are three observation <br />Z code categories. They are for use in very limited circumstances when a person is being observed for a suspected condition that is ruled out. The observation codes are not for use if an injury or illness or any signs or symptoms related to the suspected condition are present. In such cases the diagnosis/symptom code is used with the corresponding external cause code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The observation codes are primarily to be used as principal/first-listed diagnosis. An observation code may be assigned as a secondary diagnosis code when the patient is being observed for a condition that is ruled out and is unrelated to the principal/first-listed diagnosis. Also, when the principal diagnosis is required to be a code from category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of delivery, then a code from category Z05, Encounter for observation and evaluation of newborn for suspected diseases and conditions ruled out, is sequenced after the Z38 code. Additional codes may be used in addition to the observation code but only if they are unrelated to the suspected condition being observed.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Codes from subcategory Z03.7, Encounter for suspected maternal and fetal conditions ruled out, may either be used as a first-listed or as an additional code assignment depending on the case. They are for use in very limited circumstances on a maternal record when an encounter is for a suspected maternal or fetal condition that is ruled out during that encounter (for example, a maternal or fetal condition may be suspected due to an abnormal test result). These codes should not be used when the condition is confirmed. In those cases, the confirmed condition should be coded. In addition, these codes are not for use if an illness or any signs or symptoms related to the suspected condition or problem are present. In such cases the&#160;diagnosis/symptom code is used.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Additional codes may be used in addition to the code from subcategory Z03.7, but only if they are unrelated to the suspected condition being evaluated.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Codes from subcategory Z03.7 may not be used for encounters for antenatal screening of mother. <span class="CharOverride-4">See Section I.C.21. Screening</span>.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">For encounters for suspected fetal condition that are inconclusive following testing and evaluation, assign the appropriate code from category O35, O36, O40 or O41.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The observation Z code categories:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z03, Encounter for medical observation for suspected diseases and conditions ruled out</p>
			<span id="page677" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 677"></span>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.7. Aftercare:</span> Aftercare visit codes cover situations when the initial treatment of a disease has been performed and the patient requires continued care during the healing or recovery phase, or for the long-term consequences of the disease. The aftercare Z code should not be used if treatment is directed at a current, acute disease. The diagnosis code is to be used in these cases. Exceptions to this rule are codes Z51.0, Encounter for antineoplastic radiation therapy, and codes from subcategory Z51.1, Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These codes are to be first-listed, followed by the diagnosis code when a patient’s encounter is solely to receive radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy for the treatment of a neoplasm. If the reason for the encounter is more than one type of antineoplastic therapy, code Z51.0 and a code from subcategory Z51.1 may&#160;be assigned together, in which case one of these codes would be reported as a secondary diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The aftercare Z codes should also not be used for aftercare for injuries. For aftercare of an injury, assign the acute injury code with the appropriate 7th character (for subsequent encounter).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The aftercare codes are generally first-listed to explain the specific reason for the encounter. An aftercare code may be used as an additional code when some type of aftercare is provided in addition to the reason for admission and no diagnosis code is applicable. An example of this would be the closure of a colostomy during an encounter for treatment of another condition.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Aftercare codes should be used in conjunction with other aftercare codes or diagnosis codes to provide better detail on the specifics of an aftercare encounter visit, unless otherwise directed by the classification. The sequencing of multiple aftercare codes depends on the circumstances of the encounter.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Certain aftercare Z code categories need a secondary diagnosis code to describe the resolving condition or sequelae. For others, the condition is included in the code title.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Additional Z code aftercare category terms include fitting and adjustment, and attention to artificial openings.</p>
			<span id="page678" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 678"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Status Z codes may be used with aftercare Z codes to indicate the nature of the aftercare. For example, code Z95.1, Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft, may be used with code Z48.812, Encounter for surgical aftercare following surgery on the circulatory system, to indicate the surgery for which the aftercare is being performed. A status code should not be used when the aftercare code indicates the type of status, such as using Z43.0, Encounter for attention to tracheostomy, with Z93.0, Tracheostomy status.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The aftercare Z category/codes:</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.21.c.8. Follow-up:</span> The follow-up codes are used to explain continuing surveillance following completed treatment of a disease, condition, or injury. They imply that the condition has been fully treated and no longer exists. They should not be confused with aftercare codes, or injury codes with a 7th character for subsequent encounter, that explain ongoing care of a healing condition or its sequelae. Follow-up codes may be&#160;used in conjunction with history codes to provide the full picture of the healed condition and its treatment. The follow-up code is sequenced first, followed by the history code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">A follow-up code may be used to explain multiple visits. Should a condition be found to have recurred on the follow-up visit, then the diagnosis code for the condition should be assigned in place of the follow-up code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The follow-up Z code categories:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Z08, Encounter for follow-up examination after completed treatment for malignant neoplasm</p>

This code should not be used for the provision of general information regarding risks and potential side effects during routine encounters for the administration of vaccines.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub">Code Z71.87, Encounter for pediatric-to-adult transition counseling, should be assigned when pediatric-to-adult transition <span id="page680" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 680"></span>counseling is the sole reason for the encounter or when this counseling is provided in addition to other services, such as treatment of a chronic condition.

Codes in category Z34, Encounter for supervision of normal pregnancy, are always first-listed and are not to be used with any other code from the OB chapter.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Codes in category Z3A, Weeks of gestation, may be assigned to provide additional information about the pregnancy. Category Z3A codes should not be assigned for pregnancies with abortive outcomes (categories O00–O08), elective termination of pregnancy (Z33.2), nor for postpartum conditions, as category Z3A is not applicable to these conditions. The date of admission should be used to determine weeks of gestation for inpatient admissions that encompass more than one gestational week.</p>

Routine and Administrative Examinations:</span> The Z codes allow for the description of encounters for routine examinations, such as, a general check-up, or, examinations for administrative purposes, such as, a pre-employment physical. The codes are not to be used if the examination is for diagnosis of a suspected condition or for treatment purposes. In such cases the diagnosis code is used. During a routine exam, should a diagnosis or condition be discovered, it should be coded as an additional code. Pre-existing and chronic conditions and history codes may also be included as additional codes as long as the examination is for administrative purposes and not focused on any particular condition.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Some of the codes for routine health examinations distinguish between “with” and “without” abnormal findings. Code assignment depends on the information that is known at the time the encounter is being coded. For example, if no abnormal findings were found during the examination, but the encounter is being coded before test results are back, it is acceptable to assign the code for “without abnormal findings.” When assigning a code for “with abnormal findings,” additional code(s) should be assigned to identify the specific abnormal finding(s).</p>

Social Determinants of Health</span>: Social determinants of health (SDOH) codes describing social problems, conditions, or risk factors that influence a patient’s health should be assigned when this information is documented in the patient’s medical record. Assign as many SDOH codes as are necessary to describe all of the social problems, conditions, or risk factors documented during the current episode of care. For example, a patient who lives alone may suffer an acute injury temporarily impacting their ability to perform routine activities of daily living. When documented as such, this would support assignment of code Z60.2, Problems related to living alone. However, merely living alone, without documentation of a risk or unmet need for assistance at home, would not support assignment of code Z60.2. Documentation by a clinician (or patient-reported information that is signed off by a clinician) that the patient expressed concerns with access and availability of food would support assignment of code Z59.41, Food insecurity. Similarly, medical record documentation indicating the patient is homeless would support assignment of a code from subcategory Z59.0-, Homelessness.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt_sub ParaOverride-9">For social determinants of health classified to chapter 21, such as information found in categories Z55–Z65, Persons with potential health hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances, code assignment may be based on medical record documentation from clinicians involved in the care of the patient who are not the patient’s provider since this information represents social information, rather than medical diagnoses.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Coding Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services in ICD-10-CM Chapter 21</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The Z codes are intended to provide reasons for healthcare encounters or additional information about a patient encounter in different types of settings: ambulatory, inpatient, and post-acute care. Z codes are diagnosis codes. If a procedure is performed during the encounter, a procedure code is required. The Z code for the reason for the visit does not state that a procedure was performed. Z codes are used for patients who may or may not be sick but need healthcare services for a particular reason. Patients may need care for a current condition. The patient may be receiving prophylactic vaccination or immunization. An organ or tissue donor is identified with a Z code. A patient may need counseling or other services to address a problem that is not a disease or illness. The patient may be at risk for a disease that is identified with a Z code. Many times a coder will use a Z code to describe a condition or problem that has an impact on the patient’s health status and need for health services, but the situation described by the Z code is not a current illness or injury. An outline of the Z codes is as follows:</p>

			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-6">Z codes represent reasons for encounters. A corresponding procedure code must accompany a Z code if a procedure is performed. Categories Z00–Z99 are provided for occasions when circumstances other than a disease, injury or external cause classifiable to categories A00–Y89 are recorded as “diagnoses” or “problems.” This can arise in two main ways:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-12"><span class="CharOverride-1">(a)</span> When a person who may or may not be sick encounters the health services for some specific purpose, such as to receive limited care or service for a current condition, to donate an organ or tissue, to receive prophylactic vaccination (immunization), or to discuss a problem which is in itself not a disease or injury.</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-1">(b)</span> When some circumstance or problem is present which influences the person’s health status but is not in itself a current illness or injury (CDC 2023).</p>
			<span id="page689" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 689"></span>
			<p class="Text">Z code classifications are available for the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14">When a person who is currently not sick uses health services for some purpose, such as acting as a donor, receiving prophylactic care such as an inoculation or vaccination, or receiving counseling on health-related issues.<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-13"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient was admitted to donate bone marrow for another patient: Z52.3, Bone marrow donor</p></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-17">When a person with a resolving disease or injury or one with a chronic long-term condition requiring continuous care encounters the healthcare system for specific aftercare of that disease or injury (for example, chemotherapy for malignancy). A&#160;diagnosis or symptom code should be used whenever a current, acute diagnosis is being treated or a sign or symptom is being studied.<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-15"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient is admitted for antineoplastic radiation therapy, Z51.0,</p><p class="XM_first ParaOverride-16">&#9;Encounter for antineoplastic radiation therapy</p></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-17">When circumstances or problems influence a person’s health status but are not in themselves a current illness or injury.<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient visits physician’s office with a complaint of chest pain with an undetermined cause; patient is status post open-heart surgery for mitral valve replacement, six months ago: R07.9, Chest pain, unspecified; Z95.2, Presence of prosthetic heart valve</p></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-19">For newborns, to indicate birth status.<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Single newborn delivered via cesarean section: Z38.01, Single liveborn delivered by cesarean delivery</p></li>

			<p class="Text">Z codes are assigned more frequently in hospital ambulatory care departments and other primary care sites, such as physicians’ offices, than in acute inpatient facilities. Z codes may be used as either a first-listed (principal diagnosis code in the inpatient setting) or secondary code depending on the circumstances of the encounter. Certain Z codes may only be used as first listed, others only as secondary codes.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-20">Main Terms</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Z codes are indexed in the ICD-10-CM Index to Diseases and Injuries (Alphabetic Index) along with codes for diseases, conditions, and symptoms. It is necessary, however, to become familiar with the main terms in the Alphabetic Index that are related to Z codes. First, the coder should look for main terms in the Alphabetic Index that describe the reason for the encounter or admission. The terms documented in the health record will often not lead to the appropriate code. Then, the coder should ask why the patient is receiving services and what the reason is for the visit.</p>

			<p class="Text">The statement in the preceding example requires a Z code (Z43.3) because the patient was admitted for attention to an artificial opening. In addition, a procedure code must be assigned for the actual surgical closure.</p>
			<p class="Text">Figure 24.1 shows how the main terms in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases lead to Z codes. These are examples of words that indicate the reason for an encounter for healthcare services, that is, the patient is at the healthcare provider today to receive “attention to” an artificial opening such as a colostomy or to receive renal or peritoneal “dialysis.”</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">The codes from this section are used for patients who may not be acutely ill but require or request an examination by a healthcare provider for routine physical examinations and other administrative purposes such as examinations for pre-employment, entrance into the military, sports participation, and insurance reasons. Other codes here identify patients who must be observed for suspected conditions that later were proven not to exist or for follow-up examinations following the completed treatment of malignant neoplasms and other health conditions.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Category Z00, Encounter for General Examination without Complaint, Suspected or Reported Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The codes in category Z00 describe reasonably healthy adults and children who seek healthcare services for routine examinations, such as a general physical examination. Generally, the codes are only used as first-listed diagnoses. If a diagnosis or condition is identified during the course of the general medical examination, it should be reported as an additional diagnosis code. Pre-existing or chronic conditions, as well as history codes, may also be used as additional diagnoses as long as the examination was for an administrative purpose and not focused on treatment of the medical condition. Nonspecific abnormal findings found at the time of these examinations are classified to categories R70–R94. These codes are indexed in the Alphabetic Index under Admission, Encounter, Evaluation, Examination and Test.</p>

In this case, the coder would use an additional code to identify the abnormal finding or disease.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;A 55-year-old male has an appointment at his primary care physician’s office for his annual physical examination. The patient has mild eczema that is treated with over-the-counter lotions, and he had an inguinal hernia repaired during the past year.</p>

			<p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-23">Z00.01, Encounter for general adult medical examination with &#173;abnormal findings; Eczema, L30.9. The hernia is not coded because <br />it no longer exists.</p>
			<p class="Text">Subcategory Z00.1, Encounter for newborn, infant and child health examination, identifies outpatient clinic or doctor office encounters with newborns and young children. Z00.12, Encounter for routine infant or child health examination, identifies a child over 28 days old who the physician may identify as a “well baby” or “well child” visit in the office or clinic when the infant or child does not have an illness but is seen for developmental testing, immunizations, or routine health checkups. Two specific codes, Z00.110, Health examination for newborn under eight days old and Z00.111, Health examination for newborn 8 to <br />28 days old, were created for specific posthospital newborn care visits in the doctor’s office or clinic. Most healthy newborns are discharged from the hospital less than 48 hours after birth. Pediatric care standards recommend an examination by the physician within two days of that discharge or no later than 28 days after birth. During this encounter, the infant is evaluated for feeding, jaundice, hydration, and elimination problems; the clinician also assesses how well mother and infant are interacting, reviews the newborn’s laboratory and screening tests, and communicates the plan for healthcare maintenance, future immunizations, and periodic examinations.</p>
			<p class="Text">Other subcategory codes under Z00 identify examinations for a period of rapid growth in childhood, for adolescent development state, for a potential donor of organ and tissue, and for normal comparison and control in a clinical research program, along with examinations during periods of delayed growth in childhood. Finally, one code, Z00.8, Encounter for other general examination, is used for a health examination in a population survey, for example, a public health study.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Category Z01, Encounter for Other Special Examination without Complaint, Suspected or Reported Condition</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Category Z01, Encounter for other special examination without complaint, suspected or reported condition, is used to identify the reason for another type of encounter. A separate procedure code is used to identify the examination or procedure actually performed. Subcategory codes under Z01 are used to code visits for eye and vision examinations, ear and hearing examinations, dental examinations and cleanings, and blood pressure examinations. There are specific codes under subcategory Z01 that state whether or not an abnormal finding was identified during the examination. If there was an abnormal finding, a note reminds the coder to use an additional code to identify the abnormal finding. An example of this is code Z01.411, encounter for gynecological examination with abnormal findings. The coder is reminded with a “use additional code” note to add a code for screening for human papillomavirus, if applicable (Z11.51); for screening vaginal Pap smear, if applicable (Z12.72); and to identify acquired absence of uterus, if applicable (Z90.71-). Again, there are options to report the routine gynecological examination with and without abnormal findings. Codes in this category are indexed Admission for, Encounter for, or Examination, follow-up in the Alphabetic Index.</p>

			<p class="Text">Another subcategory code, Encounter for other specified special examination, Z01.8-, will be used for preprocedural cardiovascular and respiratory examinations provided to the patient, which include physical examinations as well as visits specifically for radiological examinations, laboratory examinations, and preoperative examinations. Coding guidelines state when coding encounters for routine laboratory or radiology testing in the absence of any signs, symptoms, or associated diagnosis, the coder should assign a code from subcategory <span id="page692" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 692"></span>Z01. If routine testing is performed during the same encounter as a test to evaluate a sign, symptom, or diagnosis, it is appropriate to assign both the Z code and the codes describing the reason for the nonroutine test. For patients receiving preoperative evaluations only, the coder should sequence first a code from subcategory Z01.81 to describe the pre-op consultation. Then, the coder should assign a code for the condition to describe the reason for the surgery as an additional diagnosis. The coder would also assign an additional code for any diagnosis or problem for which the service is being performed.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient is examined in the cardiologist’s office for a preprocedural cardiovascular examination prior to scheduled surgery for a right hip replacement for osteoarthritis of the right hip. The patient is known to have essential hypertension as well. The codes to be assigned are as follows:</p>
			<p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-10">Z01.810, Encounter for preprocedural cardiovascular examination</p>
			<p class="XM_IL">M16.11, Osteoarthritis of right hip</p>
			<p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-11">I10, Essential hypertension</p>
			<p class="Text">The codes in category Z01 are not used for examinations for administrative purposes (Z02.-), for suspected conditions proven not to exist (Z03.-), for laboratory or radiology examinations as a component of general medical examinations (Z00.0-), or for encounters for laboratory, radiology, and imaging examinations for patients with physical signs and symptoms. In those circumstances when a sign or symptom exists, the code for the sign or symptom should be used instead of the Z01 category codes.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Category Z03, Encounter for Medical Observation for Suspected Diseases and Conditions Ruled Out</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Category Z03, Encounter for medical observation for suspected diseases and conditions ruled out, is used when a person without a diagnosis is suspected of having an abnormal condition. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms. However, the patient requires study for the suspected condition. However, test results and examinations prove the condition does not exist or is <span class="CharOverride-1">ruled out</span>. Again, if the patient has signs and symptoms of a suspected disease, the coder should assign a code for the sign or symptom instead of the Z03 category codes. Conditions that were ruled out and reported with the Z03 category codes include toxic effect from ingested substance, problem with amniotic fluids in the pregnant female, suspected fetal anomaly, and suspected exposure to biological agents. Codes in this category are indexed “Observation; Suspected condition ruled out” in the Alphabetic Index.</p>

The <span class="CharOverride-1">follow-up codes</span> are used to explain medical surveillance following completed treatment of a disease, condition, or injury. The code means the patient has been fully treated for the condition that no longer exists. These codes are not the same as the aftercare codes in ICD-10-CM or the injury codes with a seventh character for subsequent encounter, which explain ongoing care of a healing condition or its sequelae. Follow-up codes may be used in conjunction with history codes to provide the full picture of the healed condition and its treatment.

			<p class="Text">A patient may have multiple visits for follow-up for these conditions, and the codes may be used each time. If a condition is found to have recurred during the follow-up visit, a diagnosis code for the condition would be assigned instead of the Z08 or Z09 follow-up code. Two notes appear under category code Z08 to remind the coder to use an additional code for any acquired absence of organ (Z90.-) and an additional code for a personal history of malignant neoplasm (Z85.-). Under category code Z09, a “use additional code” note appears to remind the coder to assign any applicable history of disease code (Z86.-, Z87.-) (CDC 2023). The coder must <span id="page694" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 694"></span>be aware that these codes are intended to represent the visit of a patient who has completed treatment for a condition and is being “followed” to assure the patient remains disease free. The coder must also be aware the term follow-up as it is intended in ICD-10-CM can be different from what a physician intends to describe when he uses the same phrase. When a physician documents follow-up, the physician may be describing ongoing medical treatment or a recovery phase of the illness or recent surgery.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-26">Screening is testing performed to detect disease or disease precursors in asymptomatic individuals so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those who test positive for the disease. The same type of testing performed to confirm or rule out a condition in an individual who has some physical signs or symptoms is not a screening test. When signs and symptoms are present, the testing is a diagnostic study and the diagnosis provided would be the stated signs and/or symptoms. A screening code is the first-listed code if the reason for the visit or test is specifically the screening exam. A screening code can also be used as an additional code when the screening is performed in addition to the evaluation and treatment of an office visit for example. If a condition is identified during the screening test, then the code for that condition is assigned as an additional diagnosis. A procedure code is required to confirm the screening test was completed. </p>
			<p class="Text">Examples of infectious and parasitic diseases that can be screened for include respiratory tuberculosis, other bacterial diseases, infectious with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission, human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 and other viral, infectious and parasitic diseases. However, during a pandemic when a disease is prevalent in a community, the screening code for that disease is not used.

The public health emergency for COVID-19 ended in May 2023. Effective October 1, 2023, the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting on encounters for COVID-19 screening has been revised. For encounters for COVID-19 screening on or after October 1, 2023, assign code Z11.52, Encounter for screening for COVID-19. This is the code used if the COVID-19 test result is negative. If the result was positive for COVID-19, the code for the COVID-19 infection, U07.1, should be assigned along with an additional code(s) to identify pneumonia or any other associated manifestations, when applicable.</p>

A note appears with category Z12 codes to use an additional code to identify any family history of malignant neoplasm (Z80.-) as patients with a family history of malignancy puts the patient at higher risk of having the same or related condition (CDC 2023).</p>

Two other commonly used codes are Z12.4, Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of cervix when the physician performs a screening Pap smear on an asymptomatic female patient, and Z12.72, Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of vagina when the physician performs a vaginal Pap smear on a patient who has had a hysterectomy that included the removal of the cervix. If the patient had any signs or symptoms, category codes from Z12 would not be used but rather the diagnosis codes for the signs or symptoms are assigned for the encounter.

			<p class="Text">Category Z23, Encounter for immunization, is a three-character code that is used for any encounter when the purpose of the visit is to receive any prophylactic inoculation against a disease. A procedure code must also be used to show the inoculation occurred. Vaccinations and inoculation codes may be used as secondary codes during well-baby or well-child care visits if the service was given as part of routine preventive healthcare. The type of vaccine administered is not identified by diagnosis code Z23. Under category code Z23 is a “code first” note to code any routine child examination. Another code exists in ICD-10-CM for encounter for immunization safety counseling, Z71.85. This code identifies an encounter where a parent or a patient specifically seeks vaccine counseling. The individual may be seeking an alternative vaccine or vaccine schedule or spend time with the provider asking questions about vaccine safety in order to decide whether or not to receive the vaccine. The code Z71.85, encounter for immunization safety counseling, is for the occasion when immunizations or vaccine product safety issues are discussed by the provider with the parent and/or patient.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Category Z28, Immunization Not Carried Out and Underimmunization Status</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Codes Z28.01 through Z28.9 describe specific reasons why an immunization or vaccination was not given. The reasons an immunization may not be given are medical contraindications, for example, the patient has an acute or chronic illness or an allergy, or the patient is immune compromised, which are all reasons not to receive vaccinations. Other reasons are patient’s decisions not to become immunized for reasons of belief or group pressure or simply because the patient refuses the vaccination. Other reasons identified with the codes are the fact that the patient has already had the illness the vaccine is intended to prevent or the immunization was not carried out because of the caregiver’s, parent’s, or guardian’s refusal to have it done or due to the unavailability of the vaccine. Tracking why an immunization was not given can be as important as tracking those that are given, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. These codes identify the multiple reasons why a patient did not receive a routine immunization. Another important health status that can be identified with these codes is the fact that the person or child is “underimmunized.” Code Z28.3, <span class="CharOverride-1">Underimmunization</span> status, identifies the <span id="page701" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 701"></span>patient who has not received the vaccinations that are appropriate for the person’s age. It is a level of immunization that is suboptimal for a person or population (AHA 2009, 115). The doctor may describe this status in the record as “delinquent immunization status” or “lapsed immunization scheduled status.” Appearing under the category Z28 is a direction to “Code also, if applicable, encounter for immunization safety counseling, (Z71.85.)” The Z28 codes are located in the Alphabetic Index under the main terms Delayed, Delinquent immunization status, Immunization, Lapsed immunization status, Status, Underimmunization status, or Vaccination.</p>

Services related to genetic testing and infertility services can be described with these codes. Screening for genetic carrier status is becoming more commonplace to identify individuals for certain serious genetic disease. For example, a couple may be screened either preconception or early in pregnancy to determine carrier status. If both partners are carriers, different pregnancy management may be instituted. Because most of the individuals are noncarriers, it is inappropriate to use disease codes to describe the screening encounter; instead, subcategory codes Z31.43- is used to identify an encounter for genetic testing of female for procreative management and/or Z31.44- is used to identify the testing of the male partner for genetic disease carrier status. Other codes within category Z31 identify encounters for genetic counseling and advice on procreation as well as such specific codes as Z31.83 for an encounter for assisted reproductive fertility procedure cycle. Healthcare encounters for reversal of a previous tubal ligation or vasectomy, artificial insemination, procreative investigation and testing, and genetic counseling are also coded within this category.

Subcategory code Z47.3 is subdivided to identify aftercare following explantation of joint prosthesis, specifically the shoulder joint, hip joint, or knee joint. The intent of these codes is to identify the healthcare encounter for the patient who has had their artificial joint removed, usually because of an infection in the joint or another complication. Other codes in this category identify encounters for orthopedic aftercare following surgical amputation, scoliosis surgery, or other specified orthopedic care.

Code Z51.5 can be used for long-term care facility admissions and home health services where it would be the first-listed diagnosis when the patient’s admission is for the purpose of receiving palliative care. This code would not likely be the principal diagnosis in the inpatient hospital setting. In many cases, it would be more appropriate as a secondary diagnosis in the acute care setting. Palliative care may be a decision made in the hospital and then coded as an additional diagnosis when it is determined that palliative care will be initiated and no further treatment for the terminal illness is desired. There is no time limit or minimum for the use of this code assignment. The patient’s underlying condition, such as carcinoma, heart failure, COPD, Alzheimer’s disease, or AIDS, should also be coded. Code Z51.81, Encounter for therapeutic drug level monitoring, is the correct code to use when a patient visit is for the purpose of undergoing a laboratory test to measure the drug level in the patient’s blood or urine or to measure a specific function to assess the effectiveness of a drug. Z51.81 code may be used alone if the monitoring is for a drug that the patient is on for only a brief period, not long term.

			<p class="Text-flush">Codes from the categories Z55–Z65 describe social and economic factors that patients may experience in their life and potentially impact their health. Collectively the codes in these categories describe what is referred to as “social determinants of health.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, “social determinants of health are conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play and worship and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life of outcomes and risks.” (CDC 2022) (Health People 2030 accessed 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-37">Codes describing the social determinants of health (SDOH) should be assigned when this information is documented about an individual patient. Coding professionals can use the documentation of these circumstances from social workers, case managers, nurses and community health workers that is included in the patient’s health record. These clinicians often document the patient’s social information in addition to the medical diagnoses provided established by the patient’s health care provider. Patients may report their own social information and this can be used for coding as long as the patient’s clinician or provider incorporates this information in the patient’s health record.</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-38">The categories Z55–Z65 include SDOH organized into the Z code categories:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-41">Z55&#9;Problems related to education and literacy</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-42">Z56&#9;Problems related to employment and unemployment</p>

			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-43">Z65&#9;Problems related to other psychosocial circumstances</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">There is a growing interest in providing resources to individuals who struggle with these social and economic factors. Health care systems are interested in collecting SDOH information about their patients to provide initiatives to enhance quality of life and improve their health outcomes. The “Healthy People 2030” website highlights the importance of addressing SDOH by including factors such as social and physical environments to promote good health and eliminate health disparities. The CDC website provides resources for SDOH data, research, tools for action, programs, and policy. The information may be used by providers in public health departments, community organizations, research organizations, and health care systems to assess SDOH in their area and improve their community well-being. Information and tools available on the CDC website were generated or funded by CDC within the last 10 years. The ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in the range of Z55–Z65 provided by coding professionals contributes to these work to improve health outcomes. </p>

The physician must document the medical diagnosis of overweight, obesity, or other nutritional problems to be coded. The BMI should only be assigned when there is an associated, reportable diagnosis (such as obesity). Do not assign BMI codes during pregnancy.

These people have had an allergic reaction to food or a substance and will always be considered allergic to that substance. These Z codes indicate that the person is not currently exhibiting an allergic reaction but, instead, has the potential for a reaction if exposed to the substance in the future. The Z88 codes identify allergy status to drugs and biological substances such as penicillin, sulfonamides, anesthetic agent or serum, and vaccines. The Z91.0 subcategory identifies food allergy status with six-character codes for allergies to peanuts, milk products, eggs, seafood and meats, for example. The other codes in category Z91 describe allergies to nonfood and nonmedicinals such as bee sting allergy and allergies to latex objects and radiographic dye or contrast materials.

The acquired absence of the leg below the knee is identified with codes for the right leg, left leg, and unspecified leg (Z89.511–Z89.519). Likewise, the acquired absence of the leg above the knee is identified with codes Z89.611–Z89.619. If a patient had an explantation or removal of a joint prosthesis with or without the presence of an antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer, the specific loss of a joint can be identified for the shoulder (Z89.231–Z89.239), the knee (Z89.521–Z89.529), and the hip (Z89.621–Z89.629).

Any congenital absence of an organ would be classified elsewhere in ICD-10-CM. Frequently, these codes are used to describe patients who have had a malignant condition and had surgery to remove a diseased organ. For example, acquired absence of breast and nipple (Z90.10–Z90.13), kidney (Z90.5), and prostate (Z90.79). For acquired absence of the pancreas, a use additional note appears to remind the coder to use an additional code to identify any associated insulin use (Z79.4) or postpancreatectomy diabetes mellitus (E13.-). Some of the codes within this category are important for tracking Pap smear necessity. Women who have had a total hysterectomy with <span id="page721" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 721"></span>removal of the cervix (Z90.710) no longer require cervical Pap smears but may require vaginal smears to test for vaginal malignancies. Women with a cervical stump (Z90.711) following a hysterectomy may still require cervical Pap smears. Code Z90.712 would identify the woman who has a surgically absent cervix but in whom the uterus remains. These conditions can be found in the Index under the main term “Absence,” followed by the organ name.</p>

Any of these noncompliance activities can be a detriment to a patient’s health status. Another risk to the patient can occur when the patient is noncompliant with his or her scheduled medications. Codes exist for the patient who takes less of their prescribed medication, which is identified as underdosing in ICD-10-CM. A patient may intentionally take less of their medication for financial reasons (Z91.120) or intentionally for another reason (Z91.128). In other situations, the patient may take less of the medication unintentionally because of the patient’s age-related debility such as forgetfulness or dementia (Z91.130) or unintentionally for other reasons (Z91.138).

People who fall may suffer moderate to severe injuries, including hip and other fractures and head trauma. Adults who are aged 75 years or older and fall are more likely to be admitted to a long-term care facility. Code Z91.81 can be used to identify patients who require closer monitoring to prevent falls, to justify specific diagnostic or therapeutic services to identify causes of falling, or to order preventive evaluation or services.
