			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6">Chapter 8 in ICD-10-CM classifies the Diseases of the Ear and Mastoid Process. Blocks of codes have been created to identify the types of conditions that would occur in the external ear, middle ear and mastoid, and inner ear. Like many chapters, the intraoperative and postprocedural complications are grouped at the end of the chapter rather than included in different categories. The codes include greater specificity at the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-character levels, for example, acute otitis media (AOM) with and without spontaneous rupture of the ear drum with specific codes for the type of perforation. Also included are codes for laterality for the right, left, bilateral, and unspecified sides of the body for the sites and more “code first underlying disease” notes.</p>

			<p class="Text">There are instructional notes throughout Chapter 8 to direct the coder for correct and complete coding. At the start of Chapter 8 in ICD-10-CM, there is a note to use an external cause code following the code for the ear condition, if applicable, to identify the cause of the ear condition. An Excludes2 note includes a series of excluded conditions that are applicable to all conditions classifiable to Chapter 8. For example, certain conditions originating in the perinatal period of the first 28 days of life are coded to Chapter 16 of ICD-10-CM, and certain infectious and parasitic diseases are coded to Chapter 1 instead of to the chapter for diseases of the ear and mastoid process (CDC 2023).</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Diseases of External Ear (H60–H62)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The external ear is the outer part of the ear consisting of the auricle and the external acoustic meatus that is the auditory canal, or the passage leading to the ear drum (Mosby 2022). It may also be called the outer ear. <span class="CharOverride-1">Otitis externa</span> (external otitis, swimmer’s ear) is an infection of the external auditory canal that may be classified as acute or chronic. Acute otitis externa is characterized by moderate to severe pain, fever, regional cellulitis, and partial hearing loss. Instead of pain, chronic otitis externa is characterized by pruritus, which leads to scaling and a thickening of the skin.</p>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM classifies otitis externa to category H60, Otitis externa. Subcategories H60.0 for abscess of external ear, H60.1 for cellulitis of external ear, and H60.2 for malignant otitis externa include codes for unspecified, right, left, and bilateral ears. Similarly, subcategory <span id="page291" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 291"></span>H60.3 includes fifth and sixth character codes for diffuse otitis externa, hemorrhagic otitis externa, swimmer’s ear, and other infective otitis media with specific codes for unspecified, right, left, and bilateral ears.</p>
			<p class="Text">Subcategories H62.4 and H62.8 classify otitis externa and other disorders of the external ear in diseases classified elsewhere. These codes require the reporting of the underlying disease that has caused the external ear condition. A “code first underlying disease” note appears under each subcategory, such as coding erysipelas, impetigo, or gout as the underlying disease.</p>
			<p class="XMS_first ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Otitis externa, right ear, due to erysipelas</p>
			<p class="XMS_IL ParaOverride-11">A46, Erysipelas</p>
			<p class="XMS_IL ParaOverride-11">H62.41, Otitis externa in other diseases classified elsewhere, <br />right ear</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-16">Diseases of Middle Ear and Mastoid (H65–H75)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Diseases of the middle ear and mastoid is a series of codes from H65–H75. A note to use &#173;additional code for any associated perforated tympanic membrane is included with the &#173;otitis media codes at the H65 and H66 category level. Other notes to use additional codes for &#173;exposure to smoke from environment and personal use of tobacco products are also included with the codes for otitis media or middle ear infections.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Otitis Media</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Otitis media (OM)</span> is an inflammation of the middle ear (Mosby 2022) that may be further specified in ICD-10-CM codes as suppurative or secretory, and acute or chronic. These variations and their symptoms are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-18">Acute suppurative OM is characterized by severe, deep, throbbing pain; sneezing and coughing; mild to high fever; hearing loss; dizziness; nausea; and vomiting. Suppurative infections involve the formation of pus.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Acute secretory or serous OM results in severe conductive hearing loss and, in some cases, a sensation of fullness in the ear with popping, crackling, or clicking sounds on swallowing or with jaw movement. Secretory infections produce a secretion or serous exudate.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Chronic OM has its origin in the childhood years but usually persists into adulthood. Cumulative effects of chronic OM include thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent tympanic mobility, cholesteatoma, and painless purulent discharge (NIDCD 2022a).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Acute, chronic, and unspecified types of otitis media can be coded with laterality identified for right, left, bilateral, or unspecified ears. ICD-10-CM classifies OM to categories H65, Nonsuppurative otitis media, and H66, Suppurative and unspecified otitis media. Both of these categories are subdivided to identify acute and chronic forms of OM and other specific types of OM.</p>
			<p class="Text">The following subcategory codes identify common forms of otitis media that require fifth and sixth characters to further specify the type, such as acute, subacute, chronic, recurrent, and the laterality, such as right, left, or bilateral:</p>

			<p class="Text">There are instructional notes with categories H65, H66, and H67 to use an additional code for any associated perforated tympanic membrane. Another instructional note is found under the categories H65 and H66 to use an additional code to identify use of or exposure to tobacco products.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Eustachian Salpingitis and Obstruction (H68)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-20">Acute and chronic infections of the eustachian tube as well as obstruction of the eustachian tube can be coded with category H68. The term “salpingitis” is included in the codes. <span class="CharOverride-1">Salpingitis</span> is the inflammation of a tubular site, such as a fallopian tube in the female reproductive tract as well as the eustachian tube in the middle ear. Examples of eustachian salpingitis and obstruction are as follows:</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-21">H68.011, Acute Eustachian Salpingitis, right ear</p>
			<p class="XM ParaOverride-22">H68.022, Chronic Eustachian Salpingitis, left ear</p>
			<p class="XM ParaOverride-22">H68.113, Osseous Obstruction of Eustachian Tube, bilateral</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Mastoiditis and Related Conditions (H70)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Category H70, Mastoiditis and related conditions, includes four-, five-, and six-character codes to identify acute mastoiditis, chronic mastoiditis, petrositis, and other related conditions. Laterality is included in this category to identify if the patient’s right, left, or bilateral ears are involved. Codes for an unspecified ear are also included.</p>
			<p class="Text">The definition of <span class="CharOverride-1">mastoiditis</span> is an infection of one of the mastoid bones; usually, it is an extension of a middle ear infection (Mosby 2022) that includes all inflammatory processes of the mastoid bone air cells of the temporal bone. As the mastoid bone is an extension of the middle ear cleft, many children or adults with AOM or chronic middle ear inflammatory disease will have mastoiditis. In most cases, middle ear symptoms are more obvious in the patients (that is, fever, pain, conductive hearing loss), and the disease within the mastoid is not considered a separate disease when it occurs together.</p>
			<p class="Text">Acute mastoiditis is present with AOM. In some patients, the infection spreads, and patients develop osteitis or periostitis of the mastoid process. These patients have acute surgical mastoiditis (ASM), a complication of otitis media.</p>
			<p class="Text">Chronic mastoiditis most commonly occurs with chronic suppurative otitis media and with cholesteatoma formation. Cholesteatomas are growths in the lining of the middle ear that invade and change the normal structure and function of surrounding soft tissue and bone. It is a destructive process accelerated in the presence of active infection.</p>
			<span id="page293" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 293"></span>
			<p class="Text">With AOM as the underlying disease, the most common organism causing surgical mastoiditis is <span class="CharOverride-2">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span>, followed by <span class="CharOverride-2">Haemophilus influenzae</span> and group A <span class="CharOverride-2">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>. Gram-negative organisms and <span class="CharOverride-2">Staphylococcus aureus</span> are the organisms that develop more frequently in patients with chronic mastoiditis.</p>
			<p class="Text">Most of the children admitted with acute mastoiditis have no history of recurrent AOM. In those children, <span class="CharOverride-2">S. pneumoniae</span> has been the leading pathogen, while <span class="CharOverride-2">Pseudomonas </span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#173;aeruginosa</span> causes the disease in children with recurrent AOM. Persistent otorrhea that persists more than three weeks is the most consistent sign that a process involving the mastoid has evolved.</p>
			<p class="Text">A patient with acute mastoiditis may have a high and unrelenting fever. Some of this symptomatology may be related to the associated AOM. However, if a patient has a persistent fever, particularly when the patient is receiving adequate and appropriate antimicrobial agents, this is the indication the patient has ASM.</p>
			<p class="Text">The patient feels pain deep in and behind the ear with mastoiditis, and it is typically worse at night when the patient is lying down and trying to sleep. This persistent pain is a warning sign of mastoid disease. Hearing loss is common with all infectious processes that involve the middle ear (Devan 2022).</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-23">Examples of coding mastoiditis and related conditions are as follows:</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-24">H70.002, Acute mastoiditis without complications, left ear</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-25">H70.011, Subperiosteal abscess of mastoid, right ear</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-25">H70.12, Chronic mastoiditis, left ear</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-25">H70.211, Acute petrositis, right ear</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Perforation of Tympanic Membrane (H72)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-20">The most common use of the codes in category H72 is to classify the condition of a “ruptured” tympanic membrane that can occur at the same time as acute and chronic middle ear infections. The tympanic membrane is a thin covering in the middle ear that transmits sound vibrations to the internal ear by means of the auditory ossicles. As the result of infection or inflammation, the membrane swells and then can break or rupture (Mosby 2022). However, the includes note under category H72 states that persistent posttraumatic perforation of the ear drum and postinflammatory perforation of the ear drum are included in this category (CDC 2023). There is a note to code first any associated otitis media with the codes from category H72 when the two conditions occur together. The code first note acknowledges that the otitis media is the cause of the perforation in many patients.</p>
			<p class="XMS_first ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Central perforation of the tympanic membrane of the right ear due to acute otitis media of right ear</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Diseases of the Inner Ear (H80–H83)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Diseases of the inner ear include such conditions as otosclerosis, disorders of vestibular function, such as Ménière’s disease, and different types of vertigo. Vertiginous syndromes in diseases classified elsewhere as well as other diseases of the inner ear may be coded with laterality.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Otosclerosis (H80)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Otosclerosis</span> is the growth of spongy bone in the inner ear where it causes obstruction. It causes slowly progressive conductive hearing loss. Otosclerosis affects 10 percent of the Caucasian population and is more likely to occur in middle-aged women (NIDCD 2022b). Frequency is thought to be decreasing because more people now are receiving the measles vaccination. Often the patient with otosclerosis has a family history of the disease. Pregnancy and estrogen therapy is suspected to increase the progression of otosclerosis. Symptom onset usually occurs by age 40 but can also occur later in life. The most common symptom is slowly progressive bilateral hearing loss. Vertigo is uncommon, but tinnitus or ringing in the ears may be present. These symptoms often resolve after successful surgical treatment. On physical examination, patients with conductive hearing loss often speak softly but do not realize it because they hear their voices as louder because of the enhanced bone conduction of sound (NIDCD 2022b).</p>
			<p class="XMS_first ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient has obliterative otosclerosis of the oval window within <br />the left ear</p>
			<p class="XMS_IL ParaOverride-9">&#9;H80.12, Otosclerosis involving oval window, obliterative, left ear</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Ménière’s Disease (H81.0-)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Ménière’s disease</span> is a disorder of the inner ear that causes severe dizziness (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness or congestion in the ear. Ménière’s disease usually affects only one ear (NIDCD 2017). It may be documented as idiopathic endolymphatic or labyrinthine hydrops. Endolymphatic hydrops is increased pressure within the inner ear lymphatic system. Excess pressure accumulation causes symptoms of fluctuating hearing loss, occasional episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and pressure or fullness sensation in the ears. The terms of Ménière’s disease, Ménière’s syndrome, and endolymphatic hydrops may be used as synonymous terms. However, Ménière’s disease has an unknown cause, but Ménière’s syndrome is due to endocrine abnormalities, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, autoimmune <span id="page295" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 295"></span>dysfunction, medications, parasitic infections, or hyperlipidemia. Finding the cause and &#173;treatment can be a difficult medical task. The cause may be a simple condition like dehydration or a serious disease such as a brain tumor. Medical therapy can be directed toward treatment of the actual symptoms of the acute attack or directed toward prophylactic prevention of the attacks. If Ménière’s syndrome is the final diagnosis, treatment is directed as the primary disease (that is, thyroid disease). In ICD-10-CM, Ménière’s disease, labyrinthine hydrops, Ménière’s &#173;syndrome, or vertigo is coded to one subcategory, H81.0-, with fifth characters for right ear, left ear, bilateral ears, or unspecified ear.</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">A common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The subcategory of codes H81.10–H81.13 identify laterality for right, left, bilateral, and unspecified ears. Patients describe their <span class="CharOverride-1">vertigo</span> as a feeling that their surroundings seem to whirl around them. Dizziness is not the same as vertigo. <span class="CharOverride-1">Dizziness</span> is a sensation of unsteadiness accompanied by a feeling of movement within the head. Many patients who present to their physician’s office complaining of the vertigo sensation are diagnosed with BPPV. In addition, BPPV can occur at the same time with other inner ear diseases, for example, with Ménière’s disease (NIDCD 2018).</p>

			<p class="Text">Classic BPPV is usually triggered by sitting up quickly from a supine position. Patients describe the feeling of the room spinning around them. The onset is typically sudden. <br />Patients state that they are more likely to experience the condition in the morning while trying to sit up when they are getting out of bed. The symptoms resolve quickly. However, the <br />sensation can occur again when the person moves to a sitting position while getting out of bed. This sensation can occur for a period of days to weeks. Sometimes the symptoms periodically resolve but later recur. Patients report that if they get up slowly and pause while sitting on the edge of the bed before standing they do not have the same vertigo sensations. People who have BPPV may not feel dizzy but can experience severe dizziness triggered by head movements. Many patients have few or no symptoms between the episodes of vertigo. However, some patients complain of a continual “foggy or cloudy” sensation after their vertigo starts. The cause of the vertigo may never be found. Patients who are at risk for vertigo are people who have been inactive, such as patients recovering from surgery and illnesses and spending a lot of time lying down in bed. It is also common in patients with central nervous system diseases and ear diseases, but the connection has not been established. Vertigo is also common in patients with acute alcoholism. Treatment of the condition may be vertigo-suppressant medications that relieve some of the symptoms. However, many patients simply experience a resolution of the problem on its own but continue to observe the pattern of rising slowly from bed or from a reclining position to prevent a recurrence (NLM 2023). The codes for benign paroxysmal vertigo in ICD-10-CM are as follows:</p>
			<p class="XM_first">H81.10, Benign paroxysmal vertigo, unspecified ear</p>
			<p class="XM ParaOverride-26">H81.11, Benign paroxysmal vertigo, right ear</p>

			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-20">ICD-10-CM category codes H90 and H91 contain several subcategory codes that describe various forms of hearing loss or deafness. <span class="CharOverride-1">Conductive hearing loss</span> or impairment is hearing loss caused by dysfunction of the outer or middle ear (NIDCD 2023). It is the decreased ability to hear sounds because of a defect of the sound-conducting apparatus of the ear. Conductive hearing loss in one ear (unilateral) is classified with codes H90.11–H90.12 when the patient has unrestricted hearing on the contralateral, or opposite, site. Conductive hearing loss that occurs bilaterally is classified with code H90.0. There is also the option for unspecified conductive hearing loss with code H90.2.</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Sensorineural hearing loss</span> is the decreased ability to hear sounds due to a defect in the sensory mechanisms within the ear or the nerves within the ear (NIDCD 2023). Sensorineural hearing loss may be described as sensory, neural, or central hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss with unrestricted hearing in the opposite ear is classified with codes H90.41–H90.42. The code for bilateral conductive hearing loss is H90.3. Again, there is a code H90.5 for unspecified sensorineural hearing loss.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-20">Specific codes exist for unilateral mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (H90.7-) and bilateral mixed hearing loss (H90.6), as well as code H90.8 for use when the condition is not specified as unilateral or bilateral. Another condition described as <span class="CharOverride-1">deaf nonspeaking</span> or “deafmutism” is classified with code H91.3 to identify the condition when a patient has the absence of both hearing and the faculties of speech.</p>
			<p class="Text">Examples of ICD-10-CM codes for hearing loss include the following:</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-27">&#9;H90.0, Conductive hearing loss, bilateral</p>
