		<p class="_-hd">What Is Coding?</p>
		<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Coding</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the
				transformation of verbal descriptions into numbers provided in a classification system. Codes are used
				every day to carry out simple business and personal transactions. For example, when a zip code is used
				in addressing a letter, a street address is transformed into numbers.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">In the healthcare arena, specific codes describe diagnoses and
				procedures. A </span><span class="CharOverride-2">diagnosis</span><span class="CharOverride-1">
			</span><span class="CharOverride-1">is a </span><span class="CharOverride-1">word or phrase used by a
				physician to identify a disease from which an individual suf</span><span class="CharOverride-1">fers or
				a condition for which the patient needs, seeks, or receives medical care. A surgical or therapeutic
			</span><span class="CharOverride-2">procedure</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is any single, separate,
				systematic process upon or within the body that can be complete in itself. A procedure is normally
				performed by a physician, dentist, or other licensed practitioner. A procedure can be performed with or
				without instrumentation. It is performed to restore disunited or deficient parts, remove diseased or
				injured tissues, extract foreign matter, assist in obstetrical delivery, or aid in diagnosis. Whereas
				assigning a zip code is a rather simple activity, the assignment of diagnostic and procedural codes
				requires a detailed thought process that is supported by a thorough knowledge of medical terminology,
				anatomy, and pathophysiology.</span></p>

		<h3 class="_-hd">How Are Codes Assigned and What Systems Are Used?</h3>
		<img src="../image/Icon_11.png" alt="" style="width: 50px;" />
		<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hospitals and other healthcare facilities index healthcare
				data by referring and adhering to a classification system maintained by the National Center for Health
				Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). A </span><span
				class="CharOverride-2">classification system</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a grouping of
				similar diseases and procedures organized for easy retrieval of related information. This type of system
				is used for coding or assigning numeric or alphanumeric code numbers to represent specific diseases or
				procedures. In the United States, the system that was implemented on October 1, 2015, is the
			</span><span class="CharOverride-3">International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical
				Modification</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> (ICD-10-CM) and the </span><span
				class="Italic CharOverride-4">International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedural
				Coding System</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> (ICD-10-PCS).</span></p>
		<h3 class="_-hd">History of Coding</h3>
		<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The notion of </span><span
				class="CharOverride-2">classification</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> originated at the time of the
				ancient Greeks. In the seventeenth century, English statistician John Graunt developed the London Bills
				of Mortality, which <br />provided the first documentation of the proportion of children who died before
				reaching age <br />six years. In 1838, William Farr, the registrar general of England, developed a
				system to classify deaths. In 1893, a French physician, Jacques Bertillon, introduced the Bertillon
				Classification of Causes of Death at the International Statistical Institute in Chicago.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Several countries subsequently adopted Dr. Bertillon’s system, and
				in 1898, the American Public Health Association (APHA) recommended that the registrars of Canada,
				Mexico, and the United States also adopt it. In addition, APHA recommended revising the system every
				10&#160;years to remain current with medical practice. As a result, the first international conference
				to revise the International Classification of Causes of Death convened in 1900; subsequent revisions
				occurred every 10 years. At that time, the classification system was contained in one book, which
				included an Alphabetic Index as well as a Tabular List. The book was quite small compared with current
				coding texts.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The revisions that followed contained minor changes; however, the
				sixth revision of the classification system brought drastic changes, as well as an expansion into two
				volumes. The sixth revision included morbidity and mortality conditions, and the Department of Health
				and Human Services (HHS) changed its title to reflect these changes: </span><span
				class="CharOverride-3">Manual of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and
				Causes of Death (ICD)</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. Prior to the sixth revision, responsibility
				for ICD revisions fell to the Mixed Commission, a group composed of representatives from the
				International Statistical Institute and the Health Organization of the League of Nations. In 1948, the
			</span><span class="CharOverride-2">World Health Organization (WHO)</span><span class="CharOverride-1">,
				with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, assumed responsibility for preparing and publishing the
				revisions to ICD every 10 years. WHO sponsored the seventh and eighth revisions in 1957 and 1968,
				respectively.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The entire history of coding emphasizes the determination of many
				people to provide an international classification system for compiling and presenting statistical data.
				ICD has now become the most widely used statistical classification system in the world. Although some
				countries found ICD sufficient for hospital indexing purposes, many others believed it did not provide
				adequate detail for diagnostic indexing but have since created a number of clinical modifications over
				time (WHO 2023a). In addition, the original revisions of ICD did not provide for classification of
				operative and diagnostic procedures. As a result, interested persons in the United States began to
				develop their own adaptation of ICD for use in this country.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">In 1959, the US Public Health Service published the </span><span
				class="CharOverride-3">International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Indexing of Hospital
				Records and Operation Classification (ICDA)</span><span class="CharOverride-1">.<span id="page3"
					role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 3"></span> Completed in 1962, a revision
				of this adaptation—considered to be the seventh revision of ICD—expanded a number of areas to more
				completely meet the indexing needs of hospitals. The US Public Health Service later published the
			</span><span class="CharOverride-3">Eighth Revision, International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for
				Use in the United States</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. Commonly referred to as ICDA-8, this
				classification system fulfilled its purpose to code diagnostic and operative procedural data for
				official morbidity and mortality statistics in the United States.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">In 1978, WHO published the ninth revision of ICD (ICD-9). The US
				Public Health Service modified ICD-9 to meet the needs of American hospitals and called it </span><span
				class="CharOverride-3">International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
				Modification</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> (ICD-9-CM). The ninth &#173;revision expanded the book
				to three volumes and introduced a fifth-digit subclassification. ICD-9-CM was the coding and
				classification system used in the United States to report &#173;diagnoses in all healthcare settings,
				inpatient procedures, and services for morbidity and &#173;mortality reporting starting in 1979. The
				ICD-9-CM system was discontinued in the United States on September 30, 2015 and ICD-10 was implemented
				on October 1, 2015 (CMS </span><span class="CharOverride-1">2023a</span><span
				class="CharOverride-1">).</span></p>
		<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-2">ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, and ICD-11</h3>
		<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">WHO published the 10th revision of ICD in 1990, and a number
				of countries subsequently adopted the system in either the original or an adapted form. The
				international version of the ICD-10 system has been used in the United States since January 1, 1999, for
				death certificate coding. This allows for collection of international mortality data.</span></p>
		<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A US clinical modification of the ICD-10 system was initiated in
				1994 by </span><span class="CharOverride-2">NCHS</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. NCHS is the
				federal agency responsible for collecting and disseminating information on health &#173;services
				utilization and the health status of the population in the United States. NCHS is responsible for
				developing the clinical modifications for the United States to the ICD for the reporting of diseases.
				NCHS is also responsible for the development and the use of ICD-10 in the United States. The result,
				ICD-10-CM, was released in 1998 and updated several times since the initial version. ICD-10-CM is used
				for the reporting of diseases and conditions of patients treated in all settings in the US healthcare
				system effective October 1, 2015.</span></p>
