			<p class="_-hd">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes <br />for ICD-10-CM Chapter 13</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Chapter 13 begins with a note to “use an external cause code following the code for the musculoskeletal condition, if applicable, to identify the cause of the musculoskeletal condition” (CDC 2023). An Excludes2 note identifies the other conditions, such as certain infectious, parasitic, and neoplastic diseases, that can be coded with diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The first block of codes in the chapter, M00–M02, are for infectious arthropathies, which include arthropathies due to microbiological agents. To assist coding professionals on the correct usage of categories M00–M02, an instructional note in the ICD-10-CM classification provides definitions for direct and indirect infection:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-3">Direct infection of joint</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, where organisms invade synovial tissue and microbial anti</span><span class="CharOverride-1">gen is present in the joint.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-3">Indirect infection of joint</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, which may be of two types: a reactive arthropathy, where microbial infection of the body is established but neither organisms nor antigens can be identified in the joint, and a postinfective arthropathy, where microbial antigen is present but recovery of an organism is inconstant and evidence of local multiplication is lacking (CDC 2023).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Instructional notes are added to different categories or subcategories to explain how codes should be assigned.</span></p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-15"><span class="CharOverride-3">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;M21.7,&#9;Unequal limb length (acquired)</span></p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.a. Site and laterality:</span> Most of the codes within Chapter 13 have site and laterality designations. The site represents the bone, joint or the muscle involved. For some conditions where more than one bone, joint or muscle is usually involved, such as osteoarthritis, there is a “multiple sites” code available. For categories where no multiple site code is provided and more than one bone, joint or muscle is involved, multiple codes should be used to indicate the different sites involved.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.a.1 Bone versus joint:</span> For certain conditions, the bone may be affected at the upper or lower end, (e.g., avascular necrosis of bone, M87, Osteoporosis, M80, M81). Though the portion of the bone affected may be at the joint, the site designation will be the bone, not the joint.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.b. Acute traumatic versus chronic or recurrent musculoskeletal conditions:</span> Many musculoskeletal conditions are a result of previous injury or trauma to a site, or are recurrent conditions. Bone, joint or muscle conditions that are the result of a healed injury are usually found in chapter 13. Recurrent bone, joint or muscle conditions are also usually found in chapter 13. Any current, acute injury should be coded to the appropriate injury code from chapter 19. Chronic or recurrent conditions should generally be coded with a code from chapter 13. If it is difficult to determine from the documentation in the record which code is best to describe a condition, query the provider.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.c. Coding of Pathologic Fractures:</span> 7th character A is for use as long as the patient is receiving active treatment for the fracture. While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the course of treatment for a pathological fracture, assignment of the 7th character is based on whether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider is seeing the patient for the first time.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18">7th character, D is to be used for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment for the fracture and is receiving routine care for the fracture during the healing or recovery phase. The other 7th characters, listed under each subcategory <span id="page440" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 440"></span>in the Tabular List, are to be used for subsequent encounters for treatment of problems associated with healing, such as malunions, nonunions, and sequelae.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Care for complications of surgical treatment for fracture repairs during the healing or recovery phase should be coded with the appropriate complication codes.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-5">See Section I.C.19. Coding of traumatic fractures.</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.d. Osteoporosis:</span> Osteoporosis is a systemic condition, meaning that all bones of the musculoskeletal system are affected. Therefore, site is not a component of the codes under category M81, Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture. The site codes under category M80, Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, identify the site of the fracture, not the osteoporosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.d.1 Osteoporosis without pathological fracture:</span> Category M81, Osteoporosis without current pathological fracture, is for use for patients with osteoporosis who do not currently have a pathologic fracture due to the osteoporosis, even if they have had a fracture in the past. For patients with a history of osteoporosis fractures, status code Z87.310, Personal history of (healed) osteoporosis fracture, should follow the code from M81.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline I.C.13.d.2 Osteoporosis with current pathological </span><span class="CharOverride-4">fracture:</span> Category M80, Osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, is for patients who have a current pathologic fracture at the time of an encounter.

Examples of exceptions are stress fractures (M84.3-) and pathological fractures (M84.4–M84.6-).

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-3">Osteoarthritis</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the most common type of arthritis. It is a disease of the joints that mainly affects the cartilage in the joint. Cartilage is the tissue that covers the ends of the bones; it glides over each bone, allowing smooth movements and absorbing the shock of motion. However, the cartilage can break down and wear away. When the cartilage is thin or absent, the bones under the cartilage rub together and create friction. The friction causes swelling, pain, and stiffness. This friction leads to deformity of the joint, which loses its normal shape. Bone spurs develop, and pieces of bone or cartilage break off and float in the joint space. This creates more pain and joint damage. Osteoarthritis occurs over time as a person ages, but younger people can acquire osteoarthritis from joint injuries or the stress on joints from certain occupations or playing sports. Osteoarthritis can develop in any joint, but the most common joints it occurs in are the hands, knees, hips, and spine, specifically the neck or low back (NIAMS 2019; Stacy 2021).</span></p>

Within in the arms and the legs, </span><span class="CharOverride-1">layers of fascia separate the muscle groups. Within this fascia, there are confined spaces called compartments. In the compartments, the fascia surrounds the muscles, nerves, and blood vessels to protect them. This fascia is thick and does not expand in order to shield the area. When disease or injury causes swelling in a compartment, there will be increased pressure in the area. The swelling puts pressure on the muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. If the pressure is great enough, blood will be restricted from the compartment. The loss of circulation in the compartment can lead to permanent damage to the muscles and nerves, including necrosis and tissue damage that could lead to an amputation of the limb (NLM 2022d). When the physician determines the compartment pressure is rising, the physician is likely to request a surgical consultation from a surgeon as a fasciotomy to relieve the compartment pressure is often indicated.</span></p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">Traumatic compartment syndrome occurs when swelling occurs from trauma such as a car accident or a crush injury. Swelling can also be caused by complex fractures and soft tissue injuries due to trauma. Nontraumatic compartment syndrome producing increased pressure within a muscle compartment may also be called long-term or chronic compartment syndrome. This may also be known as exertional compartment syndrome. This is not caused by one traumatic event but rather is caused by repetitive activities such as running or other athletic activities. The pressure in a muscle compartment only increases during the activity. This type of compartment syndrome is most common in the lower leg and forearm but can also occur in the hand, foot, thigh, and upper arm. Other traumatic and nontraumatic forms of compartment syndrome may be caused by external compression or soft tissue swelling such as edema or hematoma. Some specific causes are burns, frostbite, snakebite, postsurgical edema or hemorrhage, hemophilia, and anticoagulant therapy (NLM 2022d).</span></p>

The individual codes include site and laterality of the pathological fracture that is present with the osteoporosis. These are pathological fractures as the bone breaks as a result of the osteoporotic nature of the bone. The sites of the fracture may occur at the shoulder, humerus, forearm, hand, femur, lower leg, or ankle and foot. If the patient has a major osseous defect occurring with the osteoporosis, an additional code is used from the series of codes in M89.7-. If there is a drug responsible for inducing the osteoporosis, an additional code for adverse effect to identify the drug (T36–T50 with fifth or sixth character 5) is used with the codes for drug-induced osteoporosis (M80.8-).</span></p>

Coders must be cautious not to confuse the pathologic and stress fractures with the traumatic injuries that cause bones to fracture, which are coded with the traumatic fracture injury codes in ICD-10-CM. A pathologic fracture is a break in the bone due to weakening of the bone structure due to disease, such as a neoplastic tumor (metastatic carcinoma of the bone) or osteoporosis or other bone diseases such as osteomalacia or osteomyelitis (Dorland 2012, 743).

When a stress fracture is first suspected, x-rays are often negative. Days or weeks may pass before the fracture line is visible. However, a presumptive diagnosis is necessary to begin prompt treatment. The terms stress reaction, fatigue fracture, and march fracture are synonymous with stress fracture. ICD-10-CM codes in the range of M84.30–M84.38 identify the site and laterality of the bone that has the stress fracture.

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Two types of commonly performed orthopedic procedures, or procedures performed on the musculoskeletal system, include arthroscopic procedures and joint replacement procedures.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Arthroscopic Surgery</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">An </span><span class="CharOverride-3">arthroscope</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is an endoscope for examining the interior of a joint and for carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures within the joint (Dorland 2012, 158). Very small instruments are used </span><span class="CharOverride-1">with the arthroscope to perform surgical procedures on a joint, such as the repair or removal of </span><span class="CharOverride-1">tissue or to take a biopsy. Arthroscopic surgery is commonly performed on most joints, including </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the knee, shoulder, wrist, and ankle. Arthroscopic surgery is often performed on an outpatient basis, and these procedures cause less damage to the body, minimize pain and scarring, and allow </span><span class="CharOverride-1">a faster recovery than do open joint procedures involving an arthrotomy.</span></p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">The fifth character in an ICD-10-PCS code is the approach. An arthroscopic approach is identified by using the value of 4 for Percutaneous Endoscopic. If the procedure is strictly an arthroscopy with no additional procedure performed, the root operation is Inspection of the joint. According to the root operations defined in ICD-10-PCS, Inspection is “visually and/or manually exploring a body part” (CMS 2023). When a more definitive procedure is performed through an arthroscope, only the definitive procedure code is assigned using the root operation that identifies the objective of the procedure. For example, if a patient had an arthroscopic excisional debridement of the right hip joint, the root operation would be Excision or cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part. This is coded with 0SB as shown in table 16.7.</span></p>
