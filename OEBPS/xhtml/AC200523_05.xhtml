The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 2 of ICD-10-CM, which appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or on the CDC website (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<p class="B-text"><span class="CharOverride-7">I. C. 2 General guidelines</span></p>
			<p class="B-text">Chapter 2 of the ICD-10-CM contains the codes for most benign and all malignant neoplasms. Certain benign neoplasms, such as prostatic adenomas, may be found in the specific body system chapters. To properly code a neoplasm it is necessary to determine from the record if the neoplasm is benign, in-situ, malignant, or of uncertain histologic behavior. If malignant, any secondary (metastatic) sites should also be determined.</p>
			<p class="B-text">Primary malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries</p>
			<p class="B-text">A primary malignant neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous (next to each other) sites should be classified to the subcategory/code 8 (‘overlapping lesion’), unless the combination is specifically indexed elsewhere. For multiple neoplasms of the same site that are not contiguous such as tumors of different quadrants of the same breast, codes for each site should be assigned.</p>
			<p class="B-text">Malignant neoplasm of ectopic tissue</p>
			<span id="page149" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 149"></span>
			<p class="B-text">Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site of origin mentioned, e.g., ectopic pancreatic &#173;malignant &#173;neoplasm involving the stomach are coded to malignant &#173;neoplasm of pancreas, unspecified (C25.9).</p>
			<p class="B-text">The Neoplasm Table in the Alphabetic Index should be &#173;referenced first. However, if the histological term is &#173;documented, that term should be referenced first rather than going &#173;immediately to the Neoplasm Table in order to determine which &#173;column in the Neoplasm Table is appropriate. For example, if the &#173;documentation indicates “adenoma,” the coder must refer to that term in the Alphabetic Index to review the entries under this term and the&#160;instructional note to “see also neoplasm, by site, benign.” The table provides the proper code based on the type of neoplasm and the site. It is important to select the proper column in the table that corresponds to the type of neoplasm. The Tabular List should then be referenced to verify that the &#173;correct codes have been selected from the table and that a more specific site codes does not exist.</p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The coding of neoplasms requires understanding of the organization of the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms as well as the Index to Diseases and Injuries and the Tabular List to completely code the malignant, benign, and other neoplasms described by physicians in patients’ records.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The ICD-10-CM </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-10">Table of Neoplasms</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a listing of codes that follows the ICD-10-CM Index of Diseases and Injuries. The ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms is organized into seven columns. The first or the left column lists the anatomic site for the neoplasm. The next six columns provide codes for malignant primary, malignant secondary, carcinoma (CA) in situ, benign, uncertain behavior, and unspecified behavior for each anatomic site. Malignant tumor codes start with the alphabetic character C in the range of C00–C96. Benign, in situ, and neoplasms of uncertain behavior and unspecified behavior are listed in the range of D00–D49-. An example of the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms is shown in table 5.1 with the anatomic site in the first column with the next six columns specifying the ICD-10-CM diagnosis code based on the behavior of the neoplasm.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Topography and Histology</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM classifies neoplasms by topography. </span><span class="CharOverride-3">Topography</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a description of the site, region, or a special part of the body (see table 5.1 Abdomen, cavity). The ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms does not include neoplasms by histology. </span><span class="CharOverride-3">Histology</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the study of the cell structures under the microscope. Certain neoplasms are identified by the histologic name of the cell structures, for example, oat cell carcinoma of the lung. For certain neoplasms, such as for malignant melanoma and certain neuroendocrine tumors, the histology is included in <span id="page156" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 156"></span>the category and codes. The term </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-10">morphology</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the study of the physical shape or size of a </span><span class="CharOverride-1">specimen, plant, or animal (Mosby 2022). In medicine, the term morphology is also used </span><span class="CharOverride-1">to describe neoplasms, that is, the form and structure of the tumor in the organ.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The description of the neoplasm will usually indicate which of the six columns is &#173;appropriate for coding, for example, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, benign fibroadenoma of the breast, or carcinoma in situ of the larynx. When the name of the neoplasm does not readily identify the behavior of the neoplasm as malignant or benign, the coder should use the remainder of the Index to identify which column to use on the Table of Neoplasms to assign the code. For example, giant cell glioblastoma of the brain is included in the Index to Diseases and Injuries with the following entry: see Neoplasm, malignant, by site (brain). The next step for the coder is to reference the Table of Neoplasms under the anatomic site, brain, malignant, primary, to assign the code.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Laterality</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">A feature in ICD-10-CM is the concept of </span><span class="CharOverride-3">laterality</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. Codes listed in the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms with a dash (-) following the code have a required fifth character for laterality, that is, right or left side. The Tabular List must be reviewed for the complete code. Neoplasm codes are specific as to whether the location is the right or left organ when a tumor is present in an organ that exists bilaterally. Examples of laterality would be a malignant neoplasm of the upper-outer quadrant of the right female breast (C50.411) and a benign neoplasm of the left kidney (D30.02). Codes also exist for an unspecified side of bilateral locations.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">ICD-10-CM Chapter 2 Index Instructions</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">If the coder can identify the behavior and site of the neoplasm, the usual first step is to access the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms. However, the main terms and subterms in the &#173;ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries assists the coder in locating the morphological type of neoplasms. When a specific code or site is not listed in the Index, cross-references direct the coder to the Table of Neoplasms. It is essential to validate the code identified in the Table of Neoplasms in the Tabular List. The assignment of the code should not be used without this step. The following instructions for classifying neoplasms should be followed:</span></p>
			<p class="Num-list-top ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;If the morphology is stated, the coder must locate the morphology of the tumor in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries. For example, entries exist for lipoma, <span id="page157" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 157"></span>melanoma, sarcoma, and such, and specific codes for these types of neoplasms are included in the Index; the coder does not need to reference the Table of Neoplasms at all.</span></p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold CharOverride-11">2.</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;If the morphology is stated, the coder must locate the morphology of the tumor in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries. However, not every entry in the Index will include codes. For example, if the </span><span class="CharOverride-12">physician</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> writes “subependymal glioma of the brain” as the diagnosis, the Index entry of glioma, subependymal, brain (specified site) is referenced and a cross-reference directs the coder to the following entry: see Neoplasm, uncertain behavior, by site (brain).</span></p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold CharOverride-11">3.</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;If the morphology is stated but the physician does not include an anatomic site, the coder should locate the morphology of the tumor in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries. Certain types of morphology indicate the anatomic site as the only possible site where the tumor would develop. The physician would consider writing both the morphology and the site as redundant terminology. For example, the physician documents “serous papillary carcinoma” but the site is not stated. The Index entry of carcinoma, papillary, serous or carcinoma, serous, papillary is referenced and the coder will note that an entry exists for “unspecified site” and code C56.9. C56.9 is the code for malignant neoplasm of ovary, unspecified side. The coder can trust that entry because serous papillary carcinoma will only occur in an ovary.</span></p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold CharOverride-11">4.</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;If the coder is certain about the behavior of the neoplasm, for example, carcinoma is always a malignant primary tumor, the coder should reference the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms as the first step.

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM provides guidelines for coding the anatomical site of a neoplasm to the highest degree of specificity. These guidelines are discussed in the following sections.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Classification of Malignant Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Malignant neoplasms are separated into primary sites (C00–C75, C7A, C76 and C80) and &#173;secondary or metastatic sites (C7B, C77–C79), with further subdivisions by anatomic sites.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system are always coded to categories C81–C96, regardless of whether the neoplasm is stated as primary or secondary. Neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system, such as leukemias and lymphomas, are &#173;considered widespread and systemic in nature and, as such, do not metastasize. Therefore, they are not coded to category C77, Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasms of lymph nodes, which includes codes identifying secondary or metastatic neoplasms of the lymphatic system.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Neuroendocrine tumors include both malignant (C7A) and benign tumors (D3A) that arise from endocrine or neuroendocrine cells scattered throughout the body. Neuroendocrine tumors are classified into two types: carcinoid tumors and pancreatic endocrine tumors. Many of these tumors are associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes identified by &#173;ICD-10-CM subcategory codes E31.20–E31.23. There is a note under subcategory E31.2- to code also any associated malignancies and other conditions associated with the syndromes. Under category C7A, Malignant neuroendocrine tumors, there is a note to code also any associated multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome (E31.2-). Another note instructs the coder to use an additional code to identify any associated endocrine syndrome, such as carcinoid syndrome (E34.0).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Determination of the Primary Site</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The </span><span class="CharOverride-3">primary site</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is defined as the origin of the tumor. Physicians usually identify the origin of the tumor in the diagnostic statement. In some cases, however, the physician cannot identify the primary site. For these situations, ICD-10-CM provides an entry in the Table of Neoplasms titled “unknown site or unspecified” assigned to code C80.1 for malignant (primary) neoplasm, unspecified or C79.9 for secondary malignant neoplasm of unspecified site.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Category C76</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Category C76, Malignant neoplasms of other and ill-defined sites, is available for use only when a more specific site cannot be identified.

A </span><span class="CharOverride-3">secondary site</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> may be referred to as a metastatic site in the record documentation. The following subsection describes some of the principal terms used in diagnostic statements that refer to secondary malignant neoplasms.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Figure 5.2 depicts metastasis. The drawing shows how a primary cancer tumor has spread from the colon to the lung and brain, two metastatic sites. The inset shows how the cancer cells </span><span class="CharOverride-1">spread. The cells spread through the blood system and through lymph nodes to another part </span><span class="CharOverride-1">of </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the body and form a metastatic tumor. In metastasis, the original cancer cells move away from </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the primary site where it developed to another site in the body to form a second malignant </span><span class="CharOverride-1">neoplasm. The metastatic site or secondary neoplasm is always the same type of cancer as </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the primary tumor. For this reason, physicians are able to identify the source of the secondary </span><span class="CharOverride-1">neoplasm, that is, identify the primary site (NCI 2023b).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Metastatic Cancer</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="Bold CharOverride-10">Metastatic cancer</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a cancer that has spread from its original site, or what organ it first appeared, to another place in the body. A metastatic tumor is always caused by the cancer cells <span id="page161" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 161"></span>from another part of the body. Practically all cancers can form metastatic tumors. A metastatic tumor is one formed by metastatic cancer cells and is called a metastasis. The traveling of a cancer from one site to another site is also called metastasis. Metastatic cancer has the same name or cell type as the original or primary cancer. Microscopically, metastatic cancer cells look the same as the cells of the original cancer and have the same molecular features. For this reason, when a cancer spreads, the physician often continues to describe the cancer by its original site. For example, when a breast cancer spreads to the lungs and forms a metastatic tumor, the physician is likely to document the tumor as metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. In this example, the primary site is the breast, the secondary or metastatic site is the lung. This is an important concept for the coder to understand. Metastatic breast cancer is not likely to be a secondary cancer in the breast but instead a primary malignant neoplasm of the breast that has spread to another location (NCI 2020).</span></p>
			<p class="Fig-leg"><span class="Color">Figure 5.2.</span> Metastasis</p>
			<p class="T-sou"><span class="CharOverride-1">Source: National Cancer Institute 2020</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The sites of cancer metastasis are most commonly occurring in the bone, liver, and lung. Most cancers can spread to different parts of the body, but a particular primary site tumor usually spreads to one site more often than other sites in the body. Unfortunately, metastatic cancer cells can lie dormant and not grow at another body location for years before they grow into a tumor, if at all. Symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on the size and location of the metastasis. For example, cancer that spreads to the bone is likely to cause pain and can cause pathologic fractures. Cancer spreading to other sites can cause different symptoms, for example, cancer spread to the lungs causes shortness of breath. Abdominal swelling, pain, and jaundice can indicate that cancer has spread to the liver. There are circumstances when a patient’s original cancer is discovered only after the metastatic tumor has spread to another site <span id="page162" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 162"></span>and caused symptoms. For example, a man with prostate cancer may not know it exists until the prostate cancer spreads to the bones in his pelvis that causes lower back pain.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">It is also possible for a patient who was previously diagnosed with cancer to have cancer diagnosed a second time. Often this cancer is what physician’s call a “new primary,” for example, a patient with colon carcinoma is later diagnosed with breast cancer. The surgeon and pathologist can see that the cancer cells in the breast cancer did not come from the previous colon cancer. Other patients can have a “recurrence” or recurrent cancer, that is, the cancer occurs a second time in the same organ. If the cancer recurs in the same organ, it is usually called a “recurrence.”</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">It is also possible to have a patient with a metastatic tumor, but the primary tumor cannot be found. The primary site may have been too small or it might have completely degenerated. However, when the secondary site is biopsied, the pathologist knows the secondary site is metastasis because the cells of the tumor do not resemble the cells of the organ where it was found. The physician may document this as a cancer of an unknown primary origin (CUP). In this situation with a CUP, the coder will assign a code for the secondary malignancy site for the site of the metastasis and a code for primary malignant of an unknown site. A patient may also develop a metastatic site after the primary site malignant tumor has been treated and is no longer under therapy. A patient with a history of a primary malignancy would be coded as a personal history of malignant neoplasm by site. Whenever a patient has a diagnosis of a metastatic cancer, two codes are required: one for the primary malignant site or personal history of primary malignant neoplasm and one for the secondary malignant site.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The terms “metastatic to” and “direct extension to” are both used in classifying secondary malignant neoplasms in ICD-10-CM. For example, cancer described as “metastatic to” a &#173;specific site is interpreted as a secondary neoplasm of that site. Invasion through the entire wall of an organ into surrounding organs or adjacent tissues is referred to as “direct extension” or “contiguous spread” (NCI 2023b).</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Chapter 2 includes the classification of malignant conditions of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue. These conditions include lymphomas that arise out of lymph tissue, multiple myeloma that originates in bone marrow, and leukemia that forms in the blood with proliferation of abnormal leukocytes. These conditions are systemic and not isolated to a particular location, and the concept of metastatic coding discussed previously does not apply to these neoplasms. Lymphomas are classified according to their type and the specific lymph nodes involved when the diagnosis was made. Multiple myeloma is classified as to whether it is stated to be in remission, in relapse, or not having achieved remission. Leukemias are classified according to their type, such as lymphoid, myeloid, or monocytic, and how the condition currently exists (not having achieved remission, condition is in remission, or condition is in relapse). Remission occurs when the disease lessens in severity or the symptoms decrease and treatment may be discontinued. Relapse is the return of manifestations of the disease after an interval of improvement. Relapse may be considered a recurrence of the leukemia.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-PCS codes are found in the Index based on the general type of procedure. Based on the first three values of the code found in the Index, the corresponding table is located. The upper portion of each table contains a description of the first three characters of the procedure code listed in the Index, that is, the name of the section, the body system, and the root operation performed. The lower portion of the tables specifies all the valid combinations of character 4 through character 7. The four columns of the table represent the last four characters of the code. The four columns are labeled body part, approach, device, and qualifier in the Medical and Surgical section. The coder constructs the code selecting characters 4 through 7 based on the facts of the procedure documented in the operative or procedure report written by the physician.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Surgical procedures performed to treat neoplasms can occur in many body systems, such as central nervous system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, skin and breast, as well as other body systems. Tumors can develop in all parts of the body and multiple organ systems. Coders use ICD-10-PCS procedure codes from multiple parts of the Medical and Surgical Section of ICD-10-PCS as well as other sections of the coding system, such as administration and radiation therapy.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Neoplasms are often treated with removal of tumors via surgical procedures. There are </span><span class="CharOverride-1">three root operations that take out some or all of a body part with three root operations that are </span><span class="CharOverride-1">most likely related to removing a tumor: Excision, Resection, and Destruction.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-21">Excision Procedures Related to Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The root operation Excision is used for cutting out or off without replacement a part of the site identified by the body part values in the table. An Excision procedure may be done for the purpose of performing a biopsy of a tumor or lesion. A </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-10">biopsy</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the removal and examination, usually microscopic, of tissue from the body, performed to establish a precise diagnosis. The qualifier of X is used to indicate the excision is a diagnostic procedure, that is, the physician is submitting a specimen to pathology to determine if disease and what type is present in the specimen. Other therapeutic procedures would be the excision of body parts that contain malignant neoplasms, and the qualifier of Z would be used to indicate it was not a diagnostic procedure. A therapeutic procedure that involves an excision will always have the specimen submitted to pathology for a report describing the extent and type of disease present. When performing a therapeutic excision of a body part, the surgeon knows the disease is present and has made a decision on how to treat it. For example, a partial mastectomy or lumpectomy may be performed to remove a breast sparing procedure that removed the malignant lesion of the breast as the definitive treatment and leaves most of the breast in place. Refer to PCS Guideline B3.4b, biopsy followed by more definitive treatment.  When a diagnostic biopsy procedure is followed by a more definitive procedure at the same procedure site, both the biopsy and the more definitive treatment are coded.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-22">Resection Procedures Related to Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The root operation </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-10">Resection</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is used for the cutting out or off without replacement of all of a body part, as identified as one of the values of the body parts for various body <span id="page166" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 166"></span>systems. For example, a lumpectomy to treat carcinoma of the breast is coded with the root operation Excision. But if a total mastectomy, the complete removal of the breast, was performed, the root operation Resection would be used. This example can be applied to many organs that are removed in part or in total to treat a malignancy. However, the coder must apply the ICD-10-PCS definitions to the procedures described by physicians and not assume the physician’s terminology is consistent with the PCS definitions. For example, the physician may identify the procedure performed as a transurethral resection of prostate or TURP. In the operative report, the coder notes the physician removed the posterior lobe of the prostate. In this example, the root operation of Resection would </span><span class="CharOverride-1">not be applied. Table 0VT for Resection within male reproductive system includes the body part “prostate” but does not include individual body parts for lobes of the prostate. Therefore, when only the posterior lobe of the prostate is removed, it does not qualify as a Resection as the entire prostate is not removed. The correct root operation would be Excision when a part or a lobe of the prostate is removed, with a code selected from the ICD-10-PCS table 0VB (see table 5.3). When the physician identifies the procedure as a retropubic prostatectomy or perineal prostatectomy, the operative report will describe the removal of the entire prostate. This procedure meets the definition of Resection in ICD-10-PCS and should be coded using the ICD-10-PCS table of 0VT (see table 5.4).</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-21">Destruction Procedures Related to Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The root operation Destruction is defined as the physical eradication of all or a portion of a body part by the direct use of energy, force, or a destructive agent. Destruction of a tumor or lesion may be performed using heat, cold, laser, or chemicals. There is usually no tissue to submit to pathology for examination after a destruction procedure as there is no tissue remaining from the site. Certain less invasive skin cancers are treated with cryotherapy or cryosurgery where lesions are destroyed by freezing the area with liquid nitrogen to destroy the cancer cells. Cryosurgery does not involve cutting, and the treated lesion becomes scabbed over and falls off  the skin in a short period of time. Cryosurgery is a method of treatment that meets the definition of destruction.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-21">Antineoplastic Chemotherapy</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Antineoplastic chemotherapy is an infusion procedure coded with a procedure from the &#173;Administration section of ICD-10-PCS. The root operation Introduction is used to code chemotherapy. The main term is “Introduction of substance in or on.” The subterm identifies where the infusion is introduced, which would be either a central vein or a peripheral vein. <span id="page168" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 168"></span> The approach is usually Percutaneous as the needle is introduced in the vein through the <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-1">skin. The sixth character is the substance infused with value 0 for antineoplastic. Depending <br />on </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the chemical infused, there may be an appropriate qualifier assigned as the seventh character </span><span class="CharOverride-1">for other antineoplastic or monoclonal antibody. When performed on a hospitalized inpatient, the coder would review the medication administration record or the chemotherapy infusion record to identify the substance infused and the location of introduction, that is, whether it was infused through a peripheral vein, a central line vein, or an implantable infusion port using a central vein.</span></p>
