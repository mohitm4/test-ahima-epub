			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">As the reader begins to study the coding of blood disorders, it is important to understand the composition of blood. Blood contains three main types of cells: white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. White blood cells are also called monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages. Red blood cells are called erythrocytes. The third type are platelets. Figure 6.1 shows the different types of white blood cells, red blood cell, and platelets (NCI 2023).</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Anemias</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Anemia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is defined as a decrease in the number of erythrocytes (red blood cells), the quantity of hemoglobin, or the volume of packed red cells in the blood (Mosby 2022). Laboratory data reflect a decrease in red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hgb), or hematocrit (Hct). Anemia is manifested by pallor of skin and mucous membranes, shortness of breath, palpitations of the heart, soft systolic murmurs, lethargy, and fatigability.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Categories D50–D53 include codes for nutritional anemias. The most common type of anemia, iron deficiency anemia (category D50), is caused by an inadequate absorption of or excessive loss of iron. Iron deficiency anemia due to (chronic) blood loss is reported with code D50.0. The underlying cause of the bleeding should be coded when documented in the health record. Without further specification, iron deficiency anemia is reported with code D50.9.

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-11">Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia (D51)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Specific codes exist for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to intrinsic factor deficiency, B12 </span><span class="CharOverride-1">malabsorption, transcobalamin II, and other dietary vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, also </span><span class="CharOverride-1">known as vegan anemia.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Vitamin B12 and folate are important elements to enable the body to produce RBCs. The body’s building blocks for its genetic code, DNA, also uses vitamin B12 in its production. The body stores vitamin B12 in the liver from various food sources, including seafood, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products. When the body does not have enough vitamin B12, a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is produced and usually treated with replacement vitamin B12 orally or by injection.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Pernicious anemia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a form of vitamin B12 deficiency because of the body’s inability to absorb vitamin B12 and make a sufficient number of RBCs. Other conditions can also produce pernicious anemia, for example, problems in the small intestine that prevent absorption of vitamin B12 from food. In addition, a vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with a folate deficiency.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Folate Deficiency Anemia (D52)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">Specific codes exist for dietary folate deficiency and for drug-induced folate deficiency anemia as well as an unspecified folic acid deficiency anemia. Folic acid or folate aids in the production of RBCs. People get folate from eating green leafy vegetables, but the body does not store folate, so a consistent diet of these nutrients is essential in maintaining folate levels. Other causes of folate deficiency are long-term alcoholism and certain medications. However, the leading cause is a poor diet, especially in the elderly and people who do not eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Folic acid is also essential in pregnant women as it helps the fetus grow properly. Too little folic acid is suspected of causing birth defects in babies (NLM 2023a). A use additional code note appears under code D52.1, Drug-induced folate deficiency anemia, to use additional code for adverse effect, if applicable, to identify the drug (T36–T50 with fifth or sixth character 5).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Other Nutritional Anemia (D53)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Specific codes exist for protein deficiency anemia (D53.0), megaloblastic anemia NOS (D53.1), Scorbutic anemia (D53.2), Other specified nutritional anemias (D53.8), and simple chronic anemia, which is considered an unspecified form of nutritional anemia in ICD-10-CM (D53.9).</span></p>
			<span id="page177" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 177"></span>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-8">Hemolytic Anemias (D55–D59)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hemolytic anemias are blood disorders that occur when RBCs are destroyed in a process called hemolysis. Hemolysis occurs before the normal time period in which the body normally destroys them, usually about 120 days after an RBC is created. The bone marrow that produces RBCs cannot keep up with the rapid destruction, even though it will try to speed up RBC production. With hemolysis, the body has a lower number of normal levels of RBCs. </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Hemolytic anemia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a condition in which the bone marrow cannot make enough new RBCs to replace the RBCs that are destroyed too early, before the RBCs can be replaced. There are many types and causes of hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia can be acquired or inherited, but the cause may not be known (NHLBI 2023a).</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">In Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency, the RBCs are missing an enzyme called G6PD. These enzymes are proteins that drive chemical reactions in the&#160;body. The missing enzyme makes the RBCs fragile and more likely to break down. If the RBCs come in contact with certain substances in the bloodstream, they rupture and die. Many factors, including those in certain medicines, foods (like fava beans), and infections, can trigger the breakdown of the RBCs. G6PD deficiency mostly affects men <span id="page178" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 178"></span>of African or Mediterranean descent. Some states require G6PD deficiency screening for newborns (NHLBI 2023a). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) without anemia is coded to D75.A.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-22">Anemia Due to Disorders of Glycolytic Enzymes (D55.2-)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">In Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Deficiency Anemia (D55.21), the RBCs are missing an enzyme called pyruvate kinase. Not having enough of the PK enzyme causes RBCs to break down easily. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is more common among the Amish (NHLBI 2023a).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-22">Thalassemia (D56)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Specific forms of thalassemia such as alpha, beta, delta-beta, as well as thalassemia minor and other thalassemias have individual codes. </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Thalassemias</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> are inherited blood disorders, meaning that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. Thalassemias cause <br />the body to make fewer healthy RBCs and less hemoglobin than normal, which can <br />cause anemia. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in RBCs. It carries oxygen to all parts of the body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs, where it is exhaled. People who have thalassemias can have mild or severe anemia. Thalassemias often affect people of Southeast Asian, Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Mediterranean, or African descent. The treatment for thalassemias are blood transfusions to replace destroyed RBCs, and blood and marrow stem cell transplants (NHLBI 2023a).</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-22">Sickle Cell Disorders (D57)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-1">Different forms of sickle cell disorders are included in category D57. For example, specific codes exist for Hb-SS disease with crisis, including acute chest syndrome and splenic sequestration, each in a single code. Codes for other forms of sickle cell disorders including Hb-C, sickle-cell trait, sickle-cell thalassemia, Hb-SD, and Hb-SE disease are included in this category. In </span><span class="CharOverride-2">sickle cell disorder</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, the body makes abnormal hemoglobin that causes RBCs to have a sickle, or “C,” shape. These sickle cells are sticky and do not travel easily through the blood vessels. Sickle cells live only about 10 to 20 days, and the bone marrow cannot make new RBCs fast enough to replace the dying ones. In the United States, sickle cell anemia mainly affects people of African descent (NHLBI 2023a). Some states require sickle cell anemia screening for newborn babies. The treatments for sickle cell anemia include folic acid supplements made from the synthetic form of folate, antibiotics to prevent infection, medicine to reduce the number of faulty RBCs in the blood, and a medicine called hydroxyurea, which may help the body make more healthy hemoglobin and reduce the amount of faulty hemoglobin that leads to sickle cells.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Other Hereditary Hemolytic Anemias (D58)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Other hereditary hemolytic anemias that are classified to category D58 include some less common hemolytic anemias such as spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, and other hemoglobinemias, including Hb-C disease and Hb-D disease.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Hereditary Spherocytosis (D58.0)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a defect in the RBCs’ outer membranes that causes them to have a spherical or ball-like shape. The ball-shaped RBCs have a shorter than normal life span. Hereditary spherocytosis is the most common cause of hemolytic anemia among people of Northern European descent (NHLBI 2023a).</span></p>
			<span id="page179" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 179"></span>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-11">Hereditary Elliptocytosis (D58.1)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hereditary elliptocytosis is caused by a defect in the RBCs’ outer membranes that makes them oval shaped and less flexible than normal. The RBCs have a shorter than normal life span. Disorders of the RBC outer membrane, both hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis, are treated with folic acid supplements, blood transfusions, and, rarely, removal of the spleen (NHLBI 2023a).</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Aplastic and Other Anemias and Other Bone Marrow Failure <br />Syndromes (D60–D64)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Aplastic anemia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a condition in which the bone marrow is damaged. As a result, the stem cells are destroyed or develop abnormally. In this situation, the body cannot make enough RBCs, WBCs, or platelets. This type of anemia is rare, but it can be fatal. Aplastic anemia can be acquired or inherited. Many times, the cause of the aplastic anemia or the condition that triggers it is unknown. There are known causes of acquired aplastic anemia that include the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-29"><span class="CharOverride-1">High-dose radiation or chemotherapy: These cancer treatments kill cancer cells, but they also may damage other cells, such as stem cells. When stem cells are damaged, healthy RBCs, WBCs, and platelets cannot develop. Aplastic anemia may resolve after these cancer treatments are stopped.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Environmental toxins: Substances such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene can damage bone marrow, causing aplastic anemia.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Certain medicines: Certain medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and some antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol (which is rarely used in the United States), can damage the bone marrow and cause aplastic anemia.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Viral infections: Hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B-19, human immunodefi</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ciency virus (HIV), mononucleosis, and cytomegalovirus can damage the bone marrow and lead to aplastic anemia.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Autoimmune diseases: These diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may cause the immune system to attack its own cells. This can damage bone marrow cells and prevent them from making healthy new blood cells.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Other hereditary conditions can damage your stem cells, leading to aplastic anemia. These conditions include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and a megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. Some women may develop mild aplastic anemia during pregnancy. This anemia tends to go away after childbirth.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-30"><span class="CharOverride-1">In some cases, aplastic anemia is associated with another blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). A genetic mutation causes PNH. The disorder develops when abnormal stem cells in the bone marrow make blood cells with a faulty outer membrane (outside layer). This destroys RBCs and prevents the body from making enough WBCs and platelets. Aplastic anemia may only last a short time if it is due to a short-term condition, illness, or other factor. However, aplastic anemia can be a long-term condition if its cause is unknown or if an inherited condition, long-term illness, or other factor causes it (NHLBI 2023b).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM classifies aplastic anemias to categories D60–D64, with the fourth, fifth, and sixth characters indicating the specific type as shown in the following categories.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Acute posthemorrhagic anemia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> or anemia due to acute blood loss is reported with code D62. Acute posthemorrhagic anemia is a normocytic, normochromic anemia developing as a result of rapid loss of large quantities of RBCs during bleeding (Encyclopedia Britannica 2023). It may occur as a result of a massive hemorrhage that may be due to spontaneous or traumatic rupture of a large blood vessel, rupture of an aneurysm, arterial erosion from a peptic ulcer or neoplastic process, or complications of surgery from excessive blood loss. Coders should not assume that anemia following a procedure, or postoperative anemia, is acute blood loss anemia. Coding postoperative anemia as a diagnosis needs more information than this phrase. Postoperative anemia must be specified as due to (acute) blood loss (D62) or due to chronic blood loss (D50.). If the physician specifies the postoperative anemia further, it is assigned to D64.9, anemia, unspecified.</span></p>

The bleeding can damage the internal organs and can be life threatening. In vWD, there is either one of two low levels of a certain protein in the blood, or the protein itself does not function well. The protein is called von Willebrand’s factor, and it helps to make the blood clot.

Pediatricians frequently use this diagnosis in children when the source of an infection is unknown. ICD-10-CM specifically identifies bandemia with code D72.825. Category D72, other disorders of white blood cells, also includes codes for eosinophilia and leukopenia.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Diseases of the spleen, a blood-forming organ, are included in category D73. Specific codes exist for hyposplenism, hypersplenism, chronic congestive splenomegaly, abscess, cyst, and infarction of spleen.</span></p>

Other and unspecified diseases of blood and blood-forming organs are included in category D75. It includes myelofibrosis, a chronic progressive disease in which fibrous tissue replaces normal bone marrow. A progressive anemia results even though the spleen attempts to replace the lost blood production and splenomegaly can occur. Secondary polycy</span><span class="CharOverride-1">themia occurs as a result of tissue hypoxia and is associated with chronic obstructive pulmo</span><span class="CharOverride-1">nary disease, congenital heart disease, and prolonged exposures to high altitudes (higher than 10,000 feet). ICD-10-CM classifies secondary polycythemia to code D75.1. Myelofibrosis can be a primary hematologic disease or a secondary process. Code D47.1, Chronic myeloproliferative disease, is the primary form of the disease. Code D75.81 is used to code the unspecified form or the secondary form of myelofibrosis.</span></p>

HIT is a hypercoagulable state, not a hemorrhagic condition. The diagnosis is first suspected based on a fall in the platelet count by 50 percent or more occurring 5 to 12 days after beginning heparin therapy. Treatment involves the initiation of an alternative anticoagulant or direct thrombin inhibitor drugs. Code D75.82 is included in ICD-10-CM for HIT.</span></p>

Under the type of artery, the coder must identify the substance being administered, such as antihemophilic factors, blood, bone marrow, and such. The same factors are found under the subterm vein, that is, is it a central vein or a peripheral vein, where the administration is the site where the substance is to be administered.

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Two common sites for biopsies for these conditions in blood and blood-forming organs are bone marrow and lymph nodes. A bone marrow aspiration is found in the Index under the main term Drainage, bone marrow with a four-character code of 079T. An aspiration is taking out fluids from the bone marrow through a needle. The coder must identify the approach for this procedure as Open, Percutaneous, or Percutaneous Endoscopic. There is no choice for the device. The seventh character for an aspiration that is a diagnostic procedure would be value X.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">When the coder accesses the Index for a bone marrow biopsy under the main term Excision, there is no entry for bone marrow. This is not a mistake. A bone marrow biopsy does not meet the definition of an Excision as there is no cutting out or off of a body part. A bone marrow “biopsy” is, by definition, an Extraction, meaning the bone marrow is pulled or stripped out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force. Under the main term Extraction, bone marrow, the coder must know the location of the extraction, that is, iliac, sternum, or vertebral. All three entries lead to the three-character code of 07D. The fourth character is value Q for Sternum, R for Iliac, or S for Vertebral. The approach is either Open or Percutaneous, which is the typical approach. There is no value for device except for Z for no device. The qualifier is either X for diagnostic or Z for no qualifier.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A bone marrow transplant is coded as a Transfusion in ICD-10-PCS because it meets the definition of the root operation of “putting in blood or blood products.” </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Transplantation</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is defined </span><span class="CharOverride-1">as putting in or on all or a portion of a living body part taken from another individual or ani</span><span class="CharOverride-1">mal to physically take the place or function of all or a portion of a similar body part. <br />A bone marrow </span><span class="CharOverride-1">transplant is a procedure to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone mar</span><span class="CharOverride-1">row stem cells. Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all of your blood cells. Stem cell transplants are also coded with the root operation Transfusion.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Coding of a lymph node biopsy is coded to the root operation Excision or Aspiration, depending on how the specimen is removed. Usually a lymph node biopsy is performed by cutting or excision. The main term Excision is located in the ICD-10-PCS Index. The body part needs to be identified as the location of the lymphatic structure, for example, Axillary, Inguinal, Neck, and such. The three-character code given is 07B. The approach options are Open, Percutaneous, or Percutaneous Endoscopic. There is no option for device other than Z for no device. A biopsy would have the qualifier of X for diagnostic.</span></p>
