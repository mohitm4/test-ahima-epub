			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">This chapter’s discussion of Chapter 19 focuses on the poisoning and certain other consequences of external cause codes.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM does not provide different category codes to identify poisonings versus adverse effect. Instead, under a single category for a specific drug, there is one code for each drug to identify poisoning, adverse effects, and underdosing by the drug (T36–T50). The sixth character of the code generally identifies the condition resulting from the use of the drug. The poisoning codes include the intent of the poisoning, if known, such as accidental, intentional self-harm, or assault as well as a code for undetermined when the facts are not known.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-4">Underdosing</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a term in ICD-10-CM defined as taking less of a medication than is prescribed by a provider or the manufacturer’s instructions with a resulting negative health consequence. As a consequence, the patient suffers a negative health consequence, such as a worsening of the condition intended to be treated by the medication (CDC 2023).</span></p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="Medium CharOverride-8">Guideline I.C.19.e.5(a). Adverse Effect:</span> When coding an adverse effect of a drug that has been correctly prescribed and properly administered, assign the appropriate code for the nature of the adverse effect followed by the appropriate code for the adverse effect of the drug (T36–T50). The code for the drug should have a 5th or 6th character “5” (for example T36.0X5-) Examples of the nature of an adverse effect are tachycardia, delirium, gastrointestinal hemorrhaging, vomiting, hypokalemia, hepatitis, renal failure, or respiratory failure.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="Medium CharOverride-8">Guideline I.C.19.e.5(b). Poisoning:</span> When coding a poisoning or reaction to the improper use of a medication (e.g., overdose, wrong substance given or taken in error, wrong route of administration), first assign the appropriate code from categories T36–T50. The poisoning codes have an associated intent as their 5th or 6th character (accidental, intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined). If the intent of the poisoning is unknown or unspecified, code the intent as accidental intent. The undetermined intent is only for use if the documentation in the record specified that the intent cannot be determined. Use additional code(s) for all manifestations of poisonings.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">If there is also a diagnosis of abuse or dependence of the substance, the abuse or dependence is assigned as an additional code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">Examples of poisoning include:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-9">i.</span>&#9;Error was made in drug prescription</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-18">If an overdose of a drug was intentionally taken or administered and resulted in drug toxicity, it would be coded as a poisoning.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-9">iii.</span>&#9;Nonprescribed drug taken with correctly prescribed and properly administered drug</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-17">If a nonprescribed drug or medicinal agent was taken in combination with a correctly prescribed and properly administered drug, any drug toxicity or other reaction resulting from the interaction of the two drugs would be classified as a poisoning.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-9">iv.</span>&#9;Interaction of drug(s) and alcohol</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-17">When a reaction results from the interaction of a drug(s) and alcohol, this would be classified as poisoning.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-10">See Section I.C.4. if poisoning is the result of insulin pump malfunctions.</span></p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="Medium CharOverride-8">Guideline I.C.19.e.5(c). Underdosing:</span> Underdosing refers to taking less of a medication than is prescribed by a provider or a manufacturer’s instruction. Discontinuing the use of a prescribed medication on the patient’s own initiative (not directed by the patient’s provider) is also classified as an underdosing. For underdosing, assign the code from categories T36–T50 (fifth or sixth character “6”). Documentation of a change in the patient’s condition is not required in order to assign an underdosing code. Documentation that the patient is taking less of a medication than is prescribed or discontinued the prescribed medication is sufficient for code assignment.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">Codes for underdosing should never be assigned as principal or first-listed codes. If a patient has a relapse or exacerbation of the medical condition for which the drug is prescribed because of the reduction in dose, then the medical condition itself should be coded.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">Noncompliance (Z91.12-, Z91.13- and Z91.14- and Z91.A4) or complication of care (Y63.6–Y63.9) codes are to be used with an underdosing code to indicate intent, if known.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="Medium CharOverride-8">Guideline I.C.19.e.5(d). Toxic Effects:</span> When a harmful substance is ingested or comes in contact with a person, this is classified as a toxic effect. The toxic effect codes are in categories T51–T65.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Toxic effect codes have an associated intent: accidental, intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-2">I.C.19.f. Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment:</span> Sequence first the appropriate code from categories T74 (Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, confirmed) or T76 (Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, suspected) for abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, followed by any accompanying mental health or injury code(s).</p>
			<span id="page624" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 624"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">If the documentation in the medical record states abuse or neglect it is coded as confirmed (T74.-). It is coded as suspected if it is documented as suspected (T76.-).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">For cases of confirmed abuse or neglect an external cause code from the assault section (X92–Y09) should be added to identify the cause of any physical injuries. A perpetrator code (Y07) should be added when the perpetrator of the abuse is known. For suspected cases of abuse or neglect, do not report external cause or perpetrator code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">If a suspected case of abuse, neglect or mistreatment is ruled out during an encounter code Z04.71, Encounter for examination and observation following alleged adult rape or code Z04.72, Encounter for examination and observation following alleged child rape should be used, not a code from T76.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-16">If a suspected case of alleged rape or sexual abuse is ruled out during an encounter code Z04.41, Encounter for examination and observation following alleged physical adult abuse, ruled out, or code Z04.42, Encounter for examination and observation following alleged rape or sexual abuse, ruled out, should be used, not a code from T76.</p>

Kidney transplant complications:</span> Patients who have undergone kidney transplant may still have some form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) because the kidney transplant may not fully restore kidney function. Code T86.1- should be assigned for documented complications of a kidney transplant, such as transplant failure or rejection or other transplant complication. Code T86.1- should not be assigned for post kidney transplant patients who have chronic kidney (CKD) unless a transplant complication such as transplant failure or rejection is documented. If the documentation is unclear as to whether the patient has a complication of the transplant, query the provider.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Conditions that affect the function of the transplanted kidney, other than CKD, should be assigned a code from subcategory T86.1, Complications of transplanted organ, Kidney, and a &#173;secondary code that identifies the complication.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium CharOverride-8">Guideline I.C.19.g.4. Complication codes that include the external cause</span>: As with certain other T codes, some of the complications of care codes have the external cause included in the code. The code includes the nature of the complication as well as the type&#160;of procedure that caused the complication. No external cause code indicating the type of procedure is necessary for these codes.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-2">Guideline I.C.19.g.5. Complications of care codes within the body system chapters</span>: Intraoperative and postprocedural complication codes are found within the body system chapters with codes specific to the organs and structures of that body system. These codes should be sequenced first, followed by a code(s) for the specific complication, if applicable.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Complication codes from the body system chapters should be assigned for intraoperative and postprocedural complications (e.g., the appropriate complication code from chapter 9 would be assigned for a vascular intraoperative or postprocedural complication) unless the complication is specifically indexed to a T code in chapter 19.</p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index provides direction on how to code medical conditions caused by drugs used appropriately and inappropriately by a patient and causing a medical condition. Using the main term “Adverse effect,” the coder is directed to see Table of Drugs and Chemicals, categories T36–T50, with the sixth character of S. The main term “Poisoning” or “Poisoning, drug” in the Index directs the coder to see also Table of Drugs and Chemicals. The third entry for underdosing states “see also Table of Drugs and Chemicals, categories <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-1">T36–T50, with final character of 6” (CDC 2023). The Table of Drugs and Chemicals follows </span><span class="CharOverride-1">the I</span><span class="CharOverride-1">CD-10-CM Neoplasm Table that appears after the ICD-10-CM Index to Diseases and Injuries.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Table of Drugs and Chemicals</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The ICD-10-CM Table of Drugs and Chemicals is organized into seven columns with rows for the substances involved. The first, left-most column contains the name of the drug, chemical, or biologic substance. The next six columns contain ICD-10-CM codes for the following:</span></p>
			<p class="Bull-list-flush-top ParaOverride-2"><span class="BL _idGenCharOverride-1">•</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;Poisoning, accidental (unintentional)</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Not every row with a chemical name has a code in each of the six columns. This is because certain chemicals cannot produce an adverse effect or an underdosing because the substance is never used for therapeutic purposes. Codes that are found on the Table of Drugs and Chemicals are in the range of codes from T36–T50. These are combination codes that include the substance that was taken by the patient, appropriately or inappropriately, and describe the intent as well. There is a subcategory code if multiple, unspecified drugs, medicinal or biological substances are taken. For example, the codes differentiate between poisonings that are accidental, inten</span><span class="CharOverride-1">tional, assault, or are of an undetermined nature. For this reason, there is no need for an addi</span><span class="CharOverride-1">tional external cause of morbidity code for poisonings, adverse effects, and underdosing codes.</span></p>

The same process is followed when the patient has a sequela or a long-term effect of once having a reaction to a properly administered drug. First a diagnosis code should be assigned for the condition that the patient is experiencing as a result of the adverse effect of a drug. An additional code is assigned to identify the drug that caused the original reaction.

A poisoning is a &#173;condition caused by drugs, medicinal substances, and other biological substances when the substance involved is not used according to a physician’s instructions. A poisoning occurs when something is done wrong—wrong drug, wrong dose, wrong route of administration, wrong person receiving the drug, or the drug should not have been used. A poisoning can occur with prescription drugs, over-the-counter purchased medications, illegal drugs, or when drugs are taken with alcoholic beverages.

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The concept of underdosing in ICD-10-CM refers to the situation when a patient takes less of a medication than is prescribed by the provider or a manufacturer’s instruction. When the patient decides to discontinue the use of a prescription medication without being told by the patient’s <br />provider to discontinue the drug, that is also classified as an underdosing. For this situation, the code from T36–T50 specifying the drug is assigned with the fifth or sixth character of 6. The code for the drug that was underdosed is never listed first or as the principal diagnosis. When &#173;underdosing occurs, most likely the patient returns to the healthcare provider because the patient has a worsening of the medical condition that is being treated by the drug. In this situation, the medical condition is coded first. Noncompliance codes (Z91.12- or Z91.13- or Z91.14- or Z91.A4-) or complication of care (Y63.6, Y63.8–Y63.9) codes are used with the underdosing code to identify the intent if it is known.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Asphyxiation (T71)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Asphyxiation is also called suffocation. Asphyxiation is a physiological change in the body caused by a lack of oxygen in respired air, resulting in a lack of oxygen and an increased amount of carbon dioxide in the blood (Dorland 2012, 166). Specific codes are provided to identify when a condition of asphyxiation is being treated. The diagnosis for this situation may also be described by the provider as a traumatic or mechanical suffocation. There are ICD-10-CM combination codes that identify the state of asphyxiation as well as the cause of it. For example, asphyxiation could be caused by smothering under a pillow, a plastic bag placed over the head, being trapped in bed linens, or smothering by being face down or trapped in furniture. Other external events that can cause asphyxiation are accidental or intentional hanging, being trapped in a car trunk, a cave-in, or otherwise being caught in a low-oxygen environment. The codes in this category require a seventh character to identify whether the care is provided in the initial encounter, a subsequent encounter, or as a sequela.</span></p>

Any injury or mental health condition that occurs as a result of the abuse, neglect, or maltreatment is coded as an additional diagnosis. The coder must examine the record for the provider’s conclusion as to whether the abuse has been confirmed at the end of the encounter or is still suspected and unconfirmed. If the provider documents the patient’s situation as abuse or neglect, it is coded as confirmed with category T74. If the documentation states the abuse or neglect is suspected, it is coded as suspected with category T76. A perpetrator code from category Y07 is added when the perpetrator of the abuse or neglect is known. If the patient’s abuse or neglect is suspected, no code is assigned for the perpetrator identification.</span></p>

Complication codes from the body system chapters should be assigned for intraoperative and postprocedural complications. For example, the appropriate complication code from chapter 9, the circulatory system, would be assigned for a vascular intraoperative or postprocedural complication unless the complication is specifically indexed to a T code in chapter 19 described here.</span></p>

The kidney transplant may not restore the kidney function completely. Code T86.1- should be assigned for a documented complication of a kidney transplant such as transplant failure or rejection. Chronic kidney disease in a kidney transplant patient is not assigned as a complication code unless the condition is documented as a complication. If the documentation is not clearly stated, the coder is obligated to ask the provider for clarification. Patients may have another condition that affects the function of the transplanted kidney. When a provider documents that another condition affects the transplanted kidney, a code from subcategory T86.1, Complications of kidney transplant, is assigned with an additional code for the specific complication.

			<p class="_-hd">ICD-10-PCS Coding for Procedures Related to Poisoning and Certain Other Consequences of External Causes</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">There is no particular group of procedures that relate to coding of conditions addressed in this chapter. Surgical procedures are more commonly performed to treat complications of medical and surgical care. While any of the 31 root operations could be the objective of a procedure, there are a few root operations that should be addressed in this chapter.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">One of the four root operations that involve procedures to alter the diameter or route of a tubular body part is</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-12">Dilation</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. Solids, liquids, or gases pass through tubular body parts. These body parts are part of the circulatory system, digestive system, genitourinary, and respiratory system. Sometimes, these tubular body parts become narrow or stenotic and can create problems as the solids, liquids, or gases cannot pass through it. The root operation Dilation is to expand the orifice or the lumen of the tubular body part to open it or make it larger. The &#173;dilation can be accomplished by stretching a tubular body part using intraluminal pressure or by cutting part of the orifice or wall of the tubular body part. It is also possible that dilation may be an approach for another procedure to achieve its objective, for example, dilation and curettage where the objective is to remove the lining of the uterus, that is, an extraction procedure. An example of a Dilation procedure is an angioplasty of a coronary or noncoronary vessel. <br />A device can be used to perform the Dilation, such as a balloon catheter, and other devices can be left in place in the vessel to maintain the opening of the vessel, such as a stent or intraluminal device. Only a device left in place at the end of the procedure is considered in the sixth character of an ICD-10-PCS code (CMS 2023).</span></p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-1">An </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-12">Extirpation</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> procedure takes out or cuts out a solid matter from a body part (CMS 2023). The solid matter may be a foreign body, such as piece of metal, or it may be a by-product of a biological function, for example, a blood clot or a plaque deposit in a blood vessel. The medical term of “extirpation” is not commonly used in health record documentation. Instead, the coder should trust the Alphabetic Index of ICD-10-PCS when the title of an operation, such as thrombectomy, directs the coder to the code tables for Extirpation. The removal of foreign objects from the body will also be coded as Extirpation procedures. The coder must realize that the likely procedure title of “removal” of a foreign body would not be the root operation when the objective of the procedure is to take a solid matter like a foreign body. <br />A Removal procedure in ICD-10-PCS always involves removing a device, and a foreign body is not a device.</span></p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-1">Other procedures that are often required to treat complications of disease all involve devices. These root operations are Insertion, Replacement, Removal, Revision, Supplement, and Change. Each of these procedures put in a device, remove a device, correct a device, or exchange a device. The root operation </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-12">Insertion</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> has the objective of putting in a nonbiological device that monitors, assists, performs, or prevents a physiological function but does not physically take the place of a body part (CMS 2023). Commonly inserted devices include a central venous catheter for infusion or a cardiac pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">In a </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-12">Replacement</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> procedure, the original body part may be taken out before the Replacement is performed (CMS 2023). The removal of the original body part is included in the Replacement procedure. However, if the Replacement is a repeat of a previous procedure, removing the device placed during the previous procedure is coded separately as a Removal. Examples of musculoskeletal Replacement procedures are joint replacements such as hips, knees, or shoulders.</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-12">Removal</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> procedure takes out or off a device from any body part and does not involve putting in another device (CMS 2023). Usually, the patient’s condition no longer requires the device to remain in place for therapy when a Removal procedure is performed. The removal of an infusion device, drainage device, internal fixation, or joint prosthetic device is an example of this root operation.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A </span><span class="Bold CharOverride-12">Revision</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> procedure is the correction of a malfunctioning or displaced device to the extent possible (CMS 2023). The objective of a Revision procedure is to fix a device that remains in place at the end of the procedure. If the device is removed during the procedure, it is not a Revision. However, a part of the device may be taken out or put back in as part of a Revision procedure. Examples of Revision procedures are adjustment to catheters, cardiac devices, joint prostheses, or internal fixator.</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Some procedures that are commonly referred to as transplants are not coded with this root operation. For example, there is no code available for a corneal transplant, because the procedure performed in a corneal transplant does not involve a body part by ICD-10-PCS definition. In a corneal transplant, a layer of tissue is placed in a body part. For that reason, a corneal transplant is classified as a Replacement procedure by ICD-10-PCS definition. Other procedures also called transplants are bone marrow, stem cell, and pancreatic islet cell &#173;transplantations. These procedures are not coded to transplant either. Instead, these procedures are coded to the root operation Administration because these procedures involve putting in autologous or nonautologous cells instead of organs or body parts.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hemodialysis and renal replacement therapy may be performed for patients with &#173;conditions that produce renal failure that may be coded from this chapter. The amount of time the &#173;dialysis is performed is not the important factor. The type of dialysis is what should be coded. Intermittent hemodialysis is the conventional treatment usually performed for ESRD, three times a week, for less than six hours per session. Two other forms of hemodialysis are referred to as renal replacement therapy (RRT). These are performed on patients with acute kidney injury or acute renal failure and delivered to critically ill patients. Prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT), also called SLED or EDD, is performed for 6–18 hours per day and is a gentler form of dialysis on very ill patients. The second type is continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), also called CVVH or CCVHD or CVVHDF, is performed for <br />at least 18 hours a day and is the slowest and gentlest hemodialysis for patients who have acute kidney injury that has resulted in hemodynamic instability. They would not be able to tolerate the other forms of dialysis. The hemodialysis and renal replacement therapy codes are</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> <span id="page640" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 640"></span>included in the Extracorporeal or Systemic Assistance and Performance tables for the Urinary</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> body system with the 5th character identifying the duration or type of filtration, that is dialysis or renal replacement therapy:</span></p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-50"><span class="CharOverride-1">Generally, the hospital can decide how often to code the procedures on a hospitalized patient. Usually the practice is to code the intermittent hemodialysis one time for each patient receiving it, no matter how many days it is done. The practice may be coded one time per admission for each type of dialysis or renal replacement therapy instead of coding when it is performed, for example, every day during a hospital stay.</span></p>
