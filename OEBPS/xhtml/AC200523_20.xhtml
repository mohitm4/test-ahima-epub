			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">A <span class="CharOverride-1">congenital anomaly</span>, malformation, or deformation is an irregularity, abnormality, or a combination of abnormalities that are present at, and existing from, the time of birth (Dorland 2012, 95). In eukaryotic cells or cells with a true nucleus, a <span class="CharOverride-1">chromosome</span> is the structure in the nucleus consisting of chromatin carrying the genetic information of the cell. A <span class="CharOverride-1">chromosome abnormality</span> is an irregularity in the number or structure of chromosomes that may alter the course of the development of the embryo. The irregularity may be a duplicate of a chromosome, a deletion or loss of a chromosome, a translocation or exchange of a chromosome, or an alteration in the sequence of genetic material (Dorland 2012, 348).</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">Chapter 17 of ICD-10-CM is organized by body system, beginning with the Nervous system with a block of codes at the end of the chapter for chromosomal abnormalities. Because many conditions can be either congenital in origin or acquired, coders must carefully review the subterms in the Index to select the appropriate code to describe congenital conditions.</p>
			<span id="page551" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 551"></span>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">The congenital conditions are grouped into subcategories, or blocks, to make it easy to identify the type of condition included in Chapter 17. Updated terminology in the code descriptors in the chapter is specific as to the exact type of condition classified. An example of the ICD-10-CM codes for congenital conditions can be found in category Q61 with codes for specific forms of cystic kidney disease in addition to codes for less specified types of cystic kidney disease.</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">At the beginning of Chapter 17, a note states that codes from this chapter are not for use on maternal records. The codes in this chapter can be used on infant or other records. When an infant is born with a congenital anomaly, an appropriate code from Chapter 17 should be used on the infant’s record. During the admission when the infant is born, the appropriate code from category Z38 is sequenced first to identify the place of birth and the type of delivery. A secondary code is used to identify the congenital condition present at birth.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Liveborn male infant, born in the hospital via vaginal birth with tetralogy of Fallot: Z38.00, Single liveborn, delivered in hospital without mention of cesarean delivery; Q21.3, Tetralogy of Fallot</p>
			<p class="Text">However, if the patient was transferred on the day of birth to another hospital for care of the congenital anomaly, the principal diagnosis at the second hospital would be the congenital anomaly.</p>
			<span id="page552" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 552"></span>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Liveborn male infant transferred to another hospital for care of thoracic spina bifida with hydrocephalus: Q05.1, Thoracic spina bifida with hydrocephalus</p>
			<p class="Text">An important guideline states that codes for the congenital condition can be used throughout <br />the entire life of the patient as long as it is still present. Congenital condition codes are not restricted for use at the time of birth or during the perinatal period. However, if a congenital condition has been corrected, the congenital condition should no longer be coded. Instead, the coder should indicate a personal history of a congenital condition, for example, from subcategory Z87.7, Personal history of (corrected) congenital malformation.</p>
			<p class="Text">Instructions are included in Chapter 17 to direct the coder when additional codes are required. For example, a “use additional code for associated paraplegia, G82.2-” note appears with category Q05, Spina bifida. Another note appears with ICD-10-CM codes Q13.1 and Q13.81 to use an additional code for associated glaucoma, H42. Under section heading Q35–Q37, Cleft lip and cleft palate, a note appears to remind the coder to use an additional code to identify an associated malformation of the nose with code Q30.2. Another type of note appears under code Q55.3, Atresia of vas deferens, to code first any associated cystic fibrosis (E84.-). Coding guidelines also state that when a congenital condition does not have a unique code assignment, the coder should assign additional code(s) for any manifestations that may be present. For example, a malformation may be described as a syndrome with various &#173;conditions present. Under category Q87, Other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems, a directional note states “use additional code(s) to identify all associated manifestations.” A similar type of instruction is also used with chromosomal abnormality codes. For example, under section Q90–Q99, Chromosomal abnormalities, not elsewhere classified, a note appears to remind the coder to use additional codes to identify any associated physical condition or the degree of intellectual disabilities that are present with the chromosomal abnormality (CDC 2023a).</p>
			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 17 in the <span class="CharOverride-2">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 17 of ICD-10-CM, which appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or on the CDC website (CDC 2023a) or in appendix F.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">I.C.17. Chapter 17: Congenital malformations, deforma</span><span class="CharOverride-3">tions, and chromosomal abnormalities (Q00–Q99):</span> Assign an appropriate code(s) from categories Q00–Q99, Congenital Malformations, Deformations and Chromosomal Abnormalities when a malformation/deformation or chromosomal abnormality is documented. A malformation/deformation/or chromosomal abnormality may be the principal/first-listed diagnosis on a record or a secondary diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">When a malformation/deformation/or chromosomal abnormality does not have a unique code assignment, assign additional code(s) for any manifestations that may be present.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">When the code assignment specifically identifies the malformation/<br />deformation/or chromosomal abnormality, manifestations that are<span id="page553" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 553"></span> an inherent component of the anomaly should not be coded separately. Additional codes should be assigned for &#173;manifestations that are not an inherent component.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Codes from Chapter 17 may be used throughout the life of the patient. If a congenital malformation or deformity has been corrected, a personal history code should be used to identify the history of the malformation or deformity. Although present at birth, a malformation/deformation/or chromosomal abnormality may not be identified until later in life. Whenever the condition is diagnosed by the provider, it is appropriate to assign a code from codes Q00–Q99. For the birth admission, the appropriate code from category Z38, Liveborn infants, according to place of birth and type of delivery, should be sequenced as the principal diagnosis, followed by any congenital anomaly codes, Q00–Q99.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Congenital Malformations, Deformations and Chromosomal Abnormalities in ICD-10-CM Chapter 17</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Chapter 17 of ICD-10-CM, Congenital Malformations, Deformations and Chromosomal Abnormalities, contains codes in the range of Q00–Q99. Codes from Chapter 17 may be used throughout the life of the patient as long as the condition is present; the condition is not only coded at birth or when it is first diagnosed. If a congenital malformation or deformity has been corrected, a personal history code should be used to identify the history of the malformation or deformity.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">Conditions included in Chapter 17 are organized by body system—for example, Q20–Q28, Congenital malformations of the circulatory system, and Q65–Q79, Congenital malformations and deformations of the musculoskeletal system—and include laterality for limbs and bones. Specific codes are included in ICD-10-CM to further describe the congenital condition. For example, there are four codes (Q90.0–Q90.9) to identify Down syndrome as trisomy 21, nonmosaicism, mosaicism, translocation, or unspecified. Updated terminology is also included. In place of Patau’s syndrome and Edward’s syndrome, the same conditions are coded with specific types of trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 codes in the range of Q91.0–Q91.7. The terminology of Patau’s and Edward’s syndrome does appear in the Alphabetic Index but directs the coder to the index entry for trisomy 18 or trisomy 13.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">Many codes for congenital conditions and chromosomal abnormalities are included in ICD-10-CM. There are nine categories (Q90, Q91, Q92, Q93, Q95, Q96, Q97, Q98, and Q99) for chromosomal abnormalities, not elsewhere classified, to distinguish between the nonmosaicism, mosaicism, and translocation types of the abnormalities. As more has become known about these complex chromosomal abnormalities, the ICD-10-CM codes were included to report the different types of conditions.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Common Congenital Anomalies</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-5">A congenital anomaly, also known as a birth defect, has been the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States over the past several years. Birth defects substantially contribute to childhood morbidity and long-term disability. Congenital anomalies can affect almost every body system.</p>
			<p class="Text">There are three major categories of known causes of congenital anomalies:</p>
			<p class="NL_first"><span class="Bold1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1.</span>&#9;Chromosomal disorders (either hereditary or arising during conception)</p>
			<p class="NL_Mid"><span class="Num-Bold CharOverride-4">2.</span>&#9;Exposure to an environmental chemical (for example, medications, alcohol, cigarettes, solvents)</p>
			<p class="NL_Last"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">3.</span>&#9;Mother’s illness during pregnancy, exposing the infant to viral or bacterial infections</p>
			<p class="Text">The stage of fetal development at the time of exposure to one of the two latter causes is critical. Fetal development is particularly vulnerable in the first trimester of pregnancy. The life expectancy and quality of life for individuals with many birth defects has improved greatly over the years. This is a result of pioneering surgery that can correct certain defects before the infant is born, as well as neonatal intensive care units that provide specialized care and advanced technology to treat the infant.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-12">Congenital Defects of the Nervous System (Q00–Q07)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-5">Central nervous system (CNS) defects involve the brain, spinal cord, and associated tissue. These include neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, and encephalocele), microcephalous, and hydrocephalus.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">One of the more common CNS defects is spina bifida. <span class="CharOverride-1">Spina bifida</span> is a defective closure of the vertebral column when a congenital neural tube defect occurs in which there is a developmental anomaly in the posterior vertebral arch (Mosby 2017, 1267). It ranges in severity from the occult type revealing few signs to a completely open spine (rachischisis). In spina bifida cystica, the protruding sac contains meninges (meningocele), the spinal cord (myelocele), or both (myelomeningocele). Commonly seen in the lumbar, low thoracic, or sacral region, spina bifida extends for three to six vertebral segments. Figure 20.1 shows the three most common types of spina bifida. Myelomeningocele is the most serious type of spina bifida. At birth, it is noted that a sac of fluid is coming through an opening in the child’s back, and it contains damaged portions of the spinal cord and nerves. This condition causes many disabilities including urine and bowel elimination problems, loss of sensation in the feet and legs, and often the inability to move the legs (CDC 2020). Another type of spina bifida is a meningocele. When the baby is born, there is a sac of fluid coming through an opening in the back. It does not contain the spinal cord, and as a result, there is little to no nerve damage. Fortunately, the condition only causes minor disabilities. Spina bifida occulta may be referred to as a “hidden” spina bifida. When the child is born, there is no opening in the back. However, there is a small gap in the spine but hidden from view. The spinal cord and nerves are usually normal. The condition may not be discovered until later in life (CDC 2020a). This mildest form of spina bifida usually does not cause disabilities. When a baby is born with myelomeningocele, or open spina bifida with the spinal cord exposed, surgery is performed within the first few days of life to close the opening and repair of spinal cord as necessary. When the spinal cord or lumbosacral nerve roots are involved, as is usually the case, varying degrees of paralysis occur below the involved level. The paralysis also usually affects the sphincters of the bladder <span id="page555" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 555"></span>and rectum. In addition, an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles, called hydrocephalus, is associated with the lumbosacral type of spina bifida in at least 80 percent of affected patients. Health issues and treatments vary for people with different forms of spina bifida. Patients with open spina bifida unfortunately have more health issues and require more extensive treatment than do other spina bifida patients (CDC 2020).</p>
			<p class="Text">In ICD-10-CM, most types of spina bifida, excluding spina bifida occulta, are assigned to category Q05. This category is further subdivided to fourth-digit subcategories that describe the sites, such as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or sacral with presence or absence of hydrocephalus. As indicated by the Excludes1 note, Spina bifida occulta (Q76.0) would not be coded with the Q05 category codes, as it is mutually exclusive to those conditions.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-13"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;A newborn infant was transferred to the Children’s Hospital after birth and was diagnosed with lumbosacral spina bifida, specifically myelomeningocele, without hydrocephalus: Q05.7, Lumbar spina bifida without hydrocephalus.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Cardiovascular System Defects (Q20–Q28)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Cardiovascular system defects involve the heart and circulatory system and are the most common group of birth defects in infants. Surgical procedures repair defects and restore circulation to as normal as possible. Some defects can be repaired before birth, whereas others may require multiple surgical procedures after birth. Smaller defects may be repaired in a cardiac catheterization laboratory instead of an operating room. Some of the more commonly occurring cardiovascular defects are patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary artery anomalies.</p>
			<p class="Text">Descriptions of cardiovascular system defects and their common abbreviations are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-1">Hypoplastic left heart syndrome</span> (Q23.4) is a condition in which the entire left half of the heart is underdeveloped. This condition may be repaired in a series of three procedures over one year. If not treated, the condition can be fatal within one month.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Persistent/patent truncus arteriosus (PTA)</span> (Q20.0) is a failure of the fetal truncus arteriosus to divide into the aorta and pulmonary artery. It can be corrected surgically.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1"><span id="page556" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 556"></span>Pulmonary valve atresia</span> (Q22.0) and <span class="CharOverride-1">stenosis</span> (Q22.1) are conditions that obstruct or narrow the pulmonary heart valve. Mild forms are relatively well tolerated and require no intervention. More severe forms are surgically corrected.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</span> (Q21.3) is a defect characterized by four anatomical abnormalities within the heart that results in poorly oxygenated blood being pumped to the body. It can be corrected surgically.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR)</span> (Q26.2) is a malformation of all of the pulmonary veins. In this condition, the pulmonary veins empty into the right atrium, or a systemic vein, instead of into the left atrium.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Transposition of great vessels</span> or great arteries <span class="CharOverride-1">(TGV)</span> (Q20.3) is a defect in which the positions of the aorta and the pulmonary artery are transposed. Immediate surgical correction is required.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Tricuspid valve atresia and stenosis</span> (Q22.4) is the absence or narrowing of the valve between the right atrium and ventricle. Severe cases are surgically corrected.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Aortic valve stenosis (AS)</span> (Q23.0) is the congenital narrowing or obstruction of the aortic heart valve. This can be surgically repaired in some cases.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Atrial septal defect (ASD)</span> (Q21.1-)  is a hole in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). The openings may resolve without treatment or require surgical intervention. This condition may also be referred to as patent foramen ovale.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Coarctation of the aorta</span> (Q25.1) is a defect in which the aorta is narrowed somewhere along its length. Surgical correction is recommended even for mild defects.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Endocardial cushion defect</span> is a spectrum of septal defects arising from imperfect fusion of the endocardial cushions in the fetal heart (Q21.2-). This diagnosis may also be specified as atrioventricular septal defect. This condition is repaired surgically.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)</span> is a condition in which the channel between the pulmonary artery and the aorta fails to close at birth (Q25.0). Many of these close spontaneously and cause no consequences. The condition can also be surgically and medically repaired.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Ventricular septal defect (VSD)</span> (Q21.0) is a hole in the lower chambers of the heart, or the ventricles. The openings may resolve without treatment; however, the condition can be surgically corrected.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">Ebstein’s anomaly</span> (Q22.5) is a deformation or displacement of the tricuspid valve with the septal and posterior leaflets being attached to the wall of the right ventricle. Only severe cases are corrected surgically.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="_-hd">Respiratory System Defects (Q30–Q34)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Respiratory system congenital anomalies, mainly in the lungs, trachea, and nose, are life threatening, but less common than those involving other major organs. The major defect is <span class="CharOverride-1">lung hypoplasia</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">dysplasia</span>, which is the underdevelopment or abnormal development of one or both lungs (Q33.6). Other unfortunate congenital malformations in the respiratory system <br /><span id="page557" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 557"></span>are the underdevelopment or the lack or development of organs within the respiratory tract, such as the nose, trachea, bronchus, and lung. A web can be present in the larynx, and cystic lesions develop in the mediastinum. All of these respiratory anomalies require immediate medical and surgical care to correct the malformation so that the infant regains adequate respiratory function.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Digestive System and Orofacial Defects (Q35–Q37 and <br />Q38–Q45)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Digestive system defects include orofacial defects (for example, choanal atresia, or cleft palate and lip) and gastrointestinal defects (for example, esophageal atresia, rectal and intestinal atresia and stenosis, and pyloric stenosis).</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate (Q35–Q37)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-5">Cleft lip, cleft palate, and combination of the two are the most common congenital anomalies of the head and neck. A cleft is a fissure or elongated opening of a specified site, usually occurring during the embryonic stage. A <span class="CharOverride-1">cleft palate</span> is a split in the roof of the mouth (the palate), and a <span class="CharOverride-1">cleft lip</span> is the presence of one or two splits in the upper lip. Figure 20.2 is an illustration of a cleft lip. Cleft lips and palates are classified as partial or complete and can occur either bilaterally or unilaterally. The most common cleft diagnoses include unilateral cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate (Kosowski et al. 2012).</p>
			<span id="page558" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 558"></span>
			<p class="Text">In ICD-10-CM, cleft palate is classified to Q35 and cleft lip is classified to category Q36. The category Q35 for cleft palate is subdivided to describe cleft hard palate (Q35.1), cleft soft palate (Q35.2), or when both conditions are present, cleft hard palate with cleft soft palate (Q35.3). Category Q36 for cleft lip is subdivided to identify bilateral, median, or unilateral forms of the cleft lip. When both conditions exist, cleft palate with cleft lip, the fourth character codes identify which palate is involved (hard or soft) and whether the cleft lip is a bilateral or unilateral type. As is true with all medical documentation, the physician should be queried when the documentation is unclear.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The infant was seen in the Orofacial Clinic for treatment of a cleft hard palate and left-sided cleft lip: Q37.1, Cleft hard palate with unilateral cleft lip.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Pyloric Stenosis (Q40.0)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Pyloric stenosis</span> is the obstruction of the pyloric opening of the stomach (Dorland 2012, 1770). It results from hypertrophy of the circular and longitudinal muscularis of the pylorus and distal antrum of the stomach. Typically, the infant feeds well from birth until two or three weeks after birth, at which time occasional regurgitation of food, or spitting up, occurs, followed several days later by projectile vomiting. Dehydration due to the vomiting is common. ICD-10-CM assigns code Q40.0 for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The infant was seen in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic to be scheduled for surgery to repair his congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: Q40.0, Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Genitourinary Tract Defects (Q50–Q56 and Q60–Q64)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Both male and female infants may be afflicted with defects of the reproductive organs and the urinary tract. Some are relatively minor and fairly common defects that can be repaired by surgery. Some of the genitourinary tract defects are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">Abnormalities of uterus codes (Q51.0–Q51.9) identify congenital anomalies such as agenesis and aplasia of uterus, doubling of uterus with doubling of cervix and vagina, septate uterus, unicornuate uterus, bicornuate uterus, arcuate uterus, and other anomalies <span id="page559" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 559"></span>of uterus. Collectively, these conditions may be referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">Müllerian anomalies of the uterus.</span> Women are likely to be diagnosed with these conditions after seeking medical attention for infertility or repeated pregnancy loss (Chandler et al. 2009).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Different forms of <span class="CharOverride-1">bladder exstrophy</span> (Q64.10–Q64.19) are conditions in which the bladder is turned inside out with portions of the abdominal and bladder walls missing. This must be surgically repaired (Dorland 2012, 662).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Male or female <span class="CharOverride-1">epispadias</span> (Q64.0) is a relatively rare defect in which the urethra opens in an abnormal position.  In males, the urethra generally opens on the top or side of the penis rather than the tip.  The urethra may be open along the entire length of the penis.  In females, the opening is usually between the clitoris and the labia but may be in the area above the normal urethral opening (Dorland 2012, 635).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-14">Different forms of <span class="CharOverride-1">hypospadias</span> (Q54.0–Q54.9) is a relatively common defect (1 in 250 male births) that appears as an abnormal urethral opening on the penis rather than at the end. The location of the abnormal condition is identified as anterior (balanic, glandular, coronal, or subcoronal) (Q54.0), middle (distal penile, midshaft, and proximal penile) (Q54.1), and posterior (penoscrotal or scrotal) (Q54.2). Another form of posterior hypospadias may be called perineal (Q54.3). A related condition also coded to this category is the condition known as congenital chordee or chordee <br />without hypospadias. A chordee is a ventral curvature of the penis and may be present without <br />hypospadias (Q54.4). Most hypospadias will need surgical correction (CDC 2023c).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Obstructive genitourinary defect</span> is an obstruction of the ureter, renal pelvis, urethra, or bladder neck (Q62.0–Q62.8). Severity of the condition depends on the level of the obstruction. Urine accumulates behind the obstruction and produces organ damage. This condition can be corrected surgically while the fetus is in the uterus or after birth.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Renal agenesis or hypoplasia</span> (Q60.0–Q60.5) is the absence or underdevelopment of the kidneys and may be unilateral or bilateral. Newborns with bilateral renal agenesis often expire due to respiratory failure within a few hours of birth. Unilateral renal agenesis may not be detected for years (Dorland 2012, 37, 905).</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-1">Cystic or polycystic kidney disease (PKD)</span> is an inherited disorder characterized by multiple, bilateral, grapelike clusters of fluid-filled cysts that grossly enlarge the kidneys, compressing and eventually replacing functioning renal tissue. The infantile form of this condition reveals an infant with pronounced epicanthal folds, a pointed nose, a small chin, and floppy, low-set ears. Signs of respiratory distress and congestive heart failure also may be present. This condition eventually deteriorates into uremia and renal failure (NIDDK  2017). Figure 20.3 shows a comparison of a polycystic kidney and a normal kidney.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM classifies cystic kidney disease to category Q61 with the following fourth-character subcategories:</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Musculoskeletal Defects (Q65–Q79)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Musculoskeletal defects are relatively common disorders and range from minor problems to more serious conditions. Clubfoot is the most common musculoskeletal congenital anomaly.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Clubfoot</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Clubfoot,</span> or talipes equinovarus, is a general term that is used to describe a variety of congenital structural foot deformities involving the lower leg, ankle, and foot joints, ligaments, and tendons (Stedman 2012, 1647). Clubfoot deformities include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">Varus deformities, which are characterized by a turning inward of the feet (codes Q66.00–Q66.32)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Valgus deformities, which are characterized by a turning outward of the feet (codes Q66.40–Q66.42, Q66.6)</li>

			<p class="_-hd">Chromosomal Defects (Q90–Q99)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Chromosomal abnormalities are disorders that arise from abnormal numbers of chromosomes or from defects in specific fragments of the chromosomes. Each disorder is associated with a characteristic pattern of defects that arises as a consequence of the underlying chromosomal abnormality. Congenital heart defects, especially septal defects, are common among these infants and are a major cause of death. Specific forms of chromosomal abnormalities are classified with categories Q90–Q99.</p>
			<p class="Text">The more common chromosomal conditions include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-1">Down syndrome (Q90.0–Q90.9)</span> is associated with the presence of a third number 21 chromosome. Another term for Down syndrome is trisomy 21. It results in mental retardation, distinctive malformations of the face and head, and other abnormalities. The severity of these problems varies widely among the affected individuals. Down syndrome is one of the more frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Trisomy 18 or Edward’s syndrome (Q91.0–Q91.3)</span> is associated with the presence of a third number 18 chromosome. It causes major physical abnormalities and severe mental retardation. Many children with this disorder expire in the first year of life due to the abnormalities of the lungs and diaphragm, heart defects, and blood vessel malformations.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-20"><span class="CharOverride-1">Trisomy 13 or Patau’s syndrome (Q91.4–Q91.7)</span> is associated with the presence of a third number 13 chromosome. The infants have many internal and external abnormalities, including profound retardation. Death may occur in the first few days of life due to the respiratory difficulties, heart defects, and severe defects in other organ systems.<p class="XM_first _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The parents of a young child meet with the genetics counselor in the Genetics Center to review the findings of the testing done recently on their son.

			<p class="_-hd">ICD-10-PCS Procedure Coding to Correct Congenital Malformations and Deformations</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The ICD-10-PCS procedure coding system does not have a specific group of procedure codes used to treat congenital malformations and deformities (CMS 2023). Instead, newborns or other patient may have procedures performed that relate to the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, digestive systems, and others as appropriate. Other congenital malformations and deformations are not treated surgically, for example, chromosomal abnormalities are treated with medical therapies instead.</p>
			<p class="Text">Surgical procedures to correct congenital malformations, deformations, or congenital anomalies are coded based on the objective of the procedure. For example, if a hydrocephalus exists, the creation of a shunt may be necessary. The creation of a shunt is a Bypass within the Central Nervous system with the body part being the Cerebral Ventricle and the qualifier identifying the location where the bypass is directed to, for example, the peritoneal cavity for a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.</p>
			<p class="Text">Another example of a procedure to correct a congenital condition is a patient with spina bifida who requires surgical closure of the defect. The opening in the vertebral column is closed with the body part addressed as the spinal meninges. A closure as described in this type of procedure is Repair or the restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function.</p>
			<p class="Text">Surgical repair of cleft lip(s) or palate(s) may take place immediately after birth or delayed for several weeks after birth depending on the individual patient. The root operation Repair is used for procedures in the mouth and throat to restore the lip and palate to the correct anatomic position. Other possible root operations to be used depending on the procedure would be Supplement or Transfer for a palatoplasty. Each body part repaired is coded separately, for example, upper lip, hard palate, or soft palate.</p>
			<p class="Text">Congenital pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the outlet between the stomach and small intestine. It results from hypertrophy of the circular and longitudinal muscularis of the pylorus and distal antrum of the stomach. Surgery is the treatment of choice. It is usually an open procedure to cut into the pylorus. The condition is marked by a thickening of the pylorus, which is the muscular band of tissue in the stomach that controls the exit of food and gastric juices from the stomach into the small bowel. By making an incision into the pylorus to divide the muscular band, the stenosis is relieved. Based on the specific description of the procedure, the root operation is likely Division in Table 0D8 with the body part stomach, pylorus. Other possible root operations for a pyloroplasty would be Dilation, Supplement, or Repair.</p>
