			<p class="Text ParaOverride-5">A <span class="CharOverride-2">symptom</span> is any subjective evidence of disease reported by the patient to the physician. A <br />patient can describe the symptom of shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal pain. A&#160;<span class="CharOverride-2">sign</span> is objective evidence of a disease observed by the physician as the result of a physical examination or test result such as an abnormal result of a laboratory test or imaging study.</p>
			<p class="Text">Some symptoms, such as hives or urticaria (L50.9), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (K92.2), menstrual pain (N94.6), and low back pain (M54.50–M54.59), have been classified elsewhere in &#173;ICD-10-CM. Such symptoms are associated with a given organ system and thus are assigned to the chapter in ICD-10-CM that deals with the corresponding organ system.</p>
			<p class="Text">Other symptoms and signs are associated with different body systems or are of unknown cause; these are classified to Chapter 18. Examples of these types of symptoms and signs include tachycardia, epistaxis, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rash, dysuria, coma, fever, fatigue, syncope, anorexia, and dry mouth.</p>
			<span id="page569" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 569"></span>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6">As opposed to subjective symptoms, objective signs are a measurement or observation confirmed by diagnostic testing. <span class="CharOverride-2">Abnormal findings</span> include objective measurements documented in laboratory reports that are reported after examination of blood, urine, or other body fluids taken from the patient. ICD-10-CM provides codes for abnormal findings on examination of blood, urine, other body fluids, diagnostic imaging, and function studies (CDC 2023). Abnormal findings of imaging studies are the conclusions written by radiologists based on review of images collected during diagnostic x-rays, ultrasound, computed axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and thermography studies of the various parts of the patient’s body. Abnormal findings also include conclusions written by physicians in reports produced after the examination of body function with radioisotope studies or scans, electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and other function studies.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-2">Abnormal tumor markers</span> are objective measurements of biochemical substances that are indicative of the presence of tumors. A tumor marker is a substance released into the circulation by tumor tissue, and its detection in the serum indicates the presence and type of tumor (Stedman 2012, 1731). Tumor markers are used to screen, diagnose, assess prognosis, follow response to treatment, and monitor for recurrence of neoplasia. Usually, the measurement is an elevation in tumor-associated antigens (TAA) or tumor-specific antigens (TSA) such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</p>
			<p class="Text">One category, R99, is provided to describe ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality; it is only for use in the situation when a patient arrives at the emergency department or other facility as dead on arrival (DOA) and pronounced dead by the examining physicians. It does not represent the discharge disposition of death and would not be used on every patient who has expired.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes for ICD-10-CM Chapter 18</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The following note appears at the beginning of Chapter 18 outlining the conditions classified to this chapter: “This chapter includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other investigative procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable elsewhere is recorded” (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6">Signs and symptoms that point rather definitely to a given diagnosis have been assigned to a category in other chapters of the classification. In general, categories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, point perhaps equally to two or more diseases or to two or more systems of the body. Practically all categories in the chapter could be designated not otherwise specified, unknown etiology, or transient. The Alphabetic Index should be consulted to determine which symptoms and signs are to be allocated here and which to other chapters. The residual subcategories with the 4th digit of 8 (example, R05.8) are generally provided for other relevant symptoms that cannot be allocated elsewhere in the classification.</p>
			<p class="Text">The conditions, signs, and symptoms included in Chapter 18 consist of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top">Cases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Signs or symptoms existing at the time of the initial encounter that proved to be &#173;transient and whose causes could not be determined</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Provisional diagnosis in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span id="page570" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 570"></span>Cases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Cases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Certain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right (CDC 2023)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Additionally, notes for code usage appear at the subchapter level. Many of the blocks and categories in Chapter 18 have Excludes1 notes such as the one found under R09, Other symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory system, that directs the coder to locate diagnosis codes that appear in other chapters of ICD-10-CM. Guidelines that clarify code usage are also found under specific codes. Code R52, Pain unspecified, includes inclusive terms and Excludes1 notes (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 18 in the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 18 of ICD-10-CM that appear in an ICD-10-CM code book or on the CDC website (CDC 2023) or in appendix F.</p>

Chapter 18: Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (R00–R99):</span> Chapter 18 includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other investigative procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable elsewhere is recorded. Signs and symptoms that point to a specific diagnosis have been assigned to a category in other chapters of the classification.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium CharOverride-3">I.C.18.a. Use of symptom codes:</span> Codes that describe symptoms and signs are acceptable for reporting purposes when a related definitive diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the provider.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium CharOverride-3">I.C.18.b. Use of a symptom code with a definitive diagnosis code:</span> Codes for signs and symptoms may be reported in addition to a related definitive diagnosis when the sign or symptom is not routinely associated with that diagnosis, such as the various signs and symptoms associated with complex syndromes. The definitive diagnosis code should be sequenced before the symptom code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">Signs or symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process should not be assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise instructed by the classification.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.18.c. Combination codes that include symptoms:</span> ICD-10-CM contains a number of combination codes that identify both the definitive diagnosis and common symptoms of that diagnosis. When using one of these combination codes, an additional code should not be assigned for the symptom.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.18.d. Repeated falls:</span> Code R29.6, Repeated falls, is for use for encounters when a patient has recently fallen and the reason for the fall is being investigated.</p>
			<span id="page571" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 571"></span>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">Code Z91.81, History of falling, is for use when a patient has fallen in the past and is at risk for future falls. When appropriate, both codes R29.6 and Z91.81 may be assigned together.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.18.e. Coma: </span>Code R40.20, Unspecified coma, should be assigned when the underlying cause of the coma is not known, or the cause is a traumatic brain injury and the coma scale is not documented in the medical record.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">Do not report codes for unspecified coma, individual or total Glasgow coma scale scores for a patient with a medically induced coma or a sedated patient.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.18.e.1. Coma scale:</span> The coma scale codes (R40.21 to R40.24-) can be used in conjunction with traumatic brain injury codes. These codes cannot be used with code R40.2A, Nontraumatic coma due to underlying condition. They are primarily for use by trauma registries, but they may be used in any setting where this information is collected. The coma scale codes should be sequenced after the diagnosis code(s)</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">These codes, one from each subcategory, are needed to complete the scale. The 7th character indicates when the scale was recorded. The 7th character should match for all three codes.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">At a minimum, report the initial score documented on presentation at your facility. This may be a score from the emergency medicine technician (EMT) or in the emergency department. If desired, a facility may choose to capture multiple coma scale scores.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">Assign code R40.24-, Glasgow coma scale, total score, when only the total score is documented in the medical record and not the individual score(s)</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6">If multiple coma scores are captured within the first 24 hours after hospital admission, assign only the code for the score at the time of admission.  ICD-10-CM does not classify coma scores that are reported after admission but less than 24 hours later.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-4">See Section I.B.14 for coma scale documentation by clinicians other than patient’s provider</span></p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="Medium _idGenCharOverride-1">I.C.18.g. SIRS due to Non-Infectious Process:</span> The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can develop as a result of certain non-infectious disease processes, such as trauma, malignant neoplasm, or pancreatitis. When SIRS is documented with a noninfectious condition, and no subsequent infection is <span id="page571" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 572"></span>documented, the code for the underlying condition, such as an injury, should be assigned, followed by code R65.10, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin without acute organ dysfunction, or code R65.11, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin with acute organ dysfunction. If an associated acute organ dysfunction is documented, the appropriate code(s) for the specific type of organ dysfunction(s) should be assigned in addition to code R65.11. If acute organ dysfunction is documented, but it cannot be determined if the acute organ dysfunction is associated with SIRS or due to another condition (e.g., directly due to the trauma), the provider should be queried.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium CharOverride-3">I.C.18.h. Death NOS:</span> Code R99, Ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality, is only for use in the very limited circumstance when a patient who has already died is brought into an emergency department or other healthcare facility and is pronounced dead upon arrival. It does not represent the discharge disposition of death.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-6"><span class="Medium CharOverride-3">I.C.18.i. NIHSS Stroke Scale:</span> The NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) codes (R29.7–) can be used in conjunction with acute stroke codes (I60-I63) to identify the patient’s neurological status and the severity of the stroke. The stroke scale codes should be sequenced after the acute stroke diagnosis code(s).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">At a minimum, report the initial score documented. If desired, a facility may choose to capture multiple stroke scale scores.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-4">See Section I.B.14. for NIHSS stroke scale documentation by &#173;clinicians other than patient’s provider.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal <br />Clinical and Laboratory Findings in ICD-10-CM Chapter 18</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-6">Chapter 18 of ICD-10-CM, Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not Elsewhere Classified (R00–R99), includes symptoms, signs, and abnormal findings that relate to conditions in multiple body systems. Many of these codes are used for patients evaluated and treated in the outpatient settings, for example, in the physician’s office, clinic, or emergency department. That does not mean a patient with a symptom could not be admitted to the hospital. It is possible to use a Chapter 18 code as a principal or secondary diagnosis for an inpatient if the reason for the symptom, sign, or finding could not be explained after inpatient studies were completed.</p>
			<p class="Text">To help the coder locate the symptoms and signs without an established diagnosis, the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries contains such entries as abnormal, abnormality, abnormalities; elevated, elevation; findings, abnormal, inconclusive, without diagnosis; and positive.</p>
			<span id="page573" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 573"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Symptoms and Signs by Body System (R00–R69)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-6">Chapter 18 includes codes for a variety of symptoms. In some cases, symptom codes may be assigned in addition to a related definitive diagnosis when the symptoms or signs are not routinely associated with that diagnosis. The following discussion should be of assistance in determining when to assign a symptom as an additional diagnosis:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top ParaOverride-8">Conditions that are routinely associated with a disease process: Symptoms and signs that are routinely associated with the disease process should not be assigned as additional codes unless otherwise instructed by the classification.<p class="XM_first _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Nausea and vomiting with gastroenteritis: K52.9, Noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified</p><p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-7">Only the code for gastroenteritis (K52.9) is assigned. The code for nausea and vomiting (R11.2) is not assigned because these are &#173;symptoms of gastroenteritis.</p></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-11">Conditions that are not routinely associated with a disease process: Additional signs and symptoms that are not routinely associated with a disease process should be coded when present.<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient with metastases to brain admitted in comatose state: C79.31, Secondary malignant neoplasm of brain; R40.2A, Nontraumatic coma due to underlying condition</p><p class="XM_IL ParaOverride-10">The code for coma (R40.2A) should be added as an additional &#173;diagnosis; coma is a significant condition that is not routinely &#173;associated with brain metastases.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Symptoms and signs are used frequently to describe reasons for service in outpatient settings. Outpatient visits do not always allow for the type of study that is needed to determine a diagnosis. Often the purpose of the outpatient visit is to relieve the symptom rather than to determine or treat the underlying condition. Coders must code the outpatient’s condition to the highest level of certainty. The highest level of certainty is often an abnormal sign or symptom code that is assigned as the reason for the outpatient visit.</p>
			<p class="Text">Most of the categories in the blocks of codes for symptoms and signs (R00–R69) are grouped by body systems, such as categories R00–R09, Symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems, and categories R10–R19, Symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coma Scale (R40.2)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">According to the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>, subcategory R40.2, Coma, incorporates what may be documented in the health record as the <span class="CharOverride-2">Glasgow Coma Scale</span> <span class="Bold CharOverride-5">(GCS)</span>  (R40.211- – R40.236-). The GCS is a way to describe and communicate about the level of consciousness of patients with an acute brain injury. The findings of the physician’s examination of the patient’s eyes, verbal responses, and motor responses are intended to help the physician decide what medical or surgical treatment is necessary to improve the patient’s condition (GCS 2014, 2021). Figure 21.1 shows a GCS scoring tool that correlates the patient’s responses with the scale numbers assigned for each response that can be reported as individual scores for eyes open, best verbal response, or best motor response.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-13">Although the GCS codes are commonly used to assess patients, including children, with traumatic brain injury. In the ICD-10-CM Tabular List, under subcategory R40.2, there is a “Code first” note to code any associated fracture of the skull (S02.-) or intracranial injury (S06.-) There is also a “Note” that one code from each subcategory, R40.21–R40.23, is required to complete the coma scale. Each code includes the response from a child under the age of 2 years and from a child between 2 and 5 years of age as a child’s response at that age is different from that of an older child or adult. For example, under code R40.222, Coma scale, best <span id="page575" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 575"></span>verbal response, incomprehensive words, would include incomprehensible sounds from a 2- to 5-year-old child. The best score available for a patient is 15 and the worse score is a 3. The score is a way of communicating the severity of the patient’s condition (GCS 2014, 2021). The GCS scores are collected by trauma registries and research databases, but they may be used in any setting where this information is collected. The ICD-10-CM coma scale codes are sequenced after the diagnosis code(s). These codes, one from each subcategory (R40.21, R40.22, R40.23), are needed to complete the scale. The seventh character indicates when the scale was recorded, and it should match for all three codes:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-14">0—unspecified time</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">1—in the field [EMT or ambulance]</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">2—at arrival to emergency department</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">3—at hospital admission</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">4—24 hours or more after hospital admission</p>
			<p class="Text">At a minimum, report the initial score documented on presentation at the facility. This may be a score from the emergency medicine technician (EMT) or in the emergency department. If desired, a facility may choose to capture multiple GCS scores during the course of the patient’s hospitalization.</p>
			<p class="Text">Some physicians and emergency department personnel may document only one total Glasgow score. According to the coding guidelines, one ICD-10-CM code from the range of codes R40.241–R40.244, Glasgow coma scale, total score, may be the only coma scale code assigned instead of individual codes when only the total score is documented.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-16">Example of GCS scoring</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The emergency department physician determined the patient had a moderate traumatic brain injury based on his examination of the patient who demonstrated:</p>
			<p class="NL_first"><span class="Bold1 _idGenCharOverride-2">a.</span>&#9;The patient opened his eyes in response to painful stimuli (score of 2)</p>
			<p class="NL_Mid"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">b.</span>&#9;The patient’s verbal response to questions was confused and he was disoriented (score of 4)</p>
			<p class="NL_Mid"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">c.</span>&#9;The patient had abnormal flexion as his motor response (score of 3)</p>
			<p class="NL_Last"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">d.</span>&#9;Total score was 9</p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-17">For this patient, the GCS codes would be (a) R40.212, Coma scale, eyes open, to pain; <br />(b) R40.224, Coma scale, best verbal response, confused conversation; and (c) R40.233, Coma scale, best motor response, abnormal with the seventh character added to identify when the assessment was made, for example, (2) for at arrival to emergency department.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-18">Altered Mental Status, Unspecified (R41.82)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Code R41.82, <span class="CharOverride-2">Altered mental status</span>, unspecified, identifies a frequent clinical state that requires investigation. This condition is a general change in brain function, such as confusion, slow responses to stimuli or questions, forgetfulness, loss of orientation, unusual or strange behavior, and other mood and mental health issues (Cleveland Clinic 2022).</p>
			<p class="Text">Altered mental status or a change in mental status can be a symptom of many different illnesses. Underlying etiology may include trauma, infection, neoplasm, or alcohol and drug use, <span id="page576" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 576"></span>as well as endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, and diseases of the kidney. Altered mental status is not to be confused with altered level of consciousness (R40.-) or disorientation or delirium (R41.0). Altered level of consciousness is difficult to define as this condition can vary widely from confusion to stupor to coma. Sometimes, the patient will be described as sleeping a lot and remaining drowsy and confused when awake. Delirium is a serious condition that exhibits a sudden state of severe confusion and rapid decline in brain function, sometimes associated with hallucinations, that develops within a short timeframe of just hours to days (Dryden-Edwards 2022). It is important that the coder codes the diagnosis or condition as documented by the physician, that is, altered mental status, altered level of consciousness or delirium, and not consider the terminology as equivalent as the physician will apply the description of the patient considering each particular patient and his or her medical situation.</p>
			<p class="Text">After workup, if a specific cause of the altered mental status is known, that condition should be coded, and the symptom code should not be used. An Excludes1 note appears under code R41.82 that states if the altered mental status is due to a known condition, the coder should code to that condition and not use this code.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient is an 80-year-old female who was brought to the physician’s office by her husband who explains to the physician that his wife “hasn’t been herself” the past two days as she originally stated she had painful urination but then became confused and seemingly less alert. The physician ordered a urinalysis and complete blood count and advised the patient and husband that she would call them at home when the results of the lab work were completed in the event that medications should be prescribed. The physician documented the diagnosis of altered mental status and possible urinary tract infection in the patient’s record: R41.82, Altered mental status, unspecified. The possible urinary tract infection was not coded as qualified diagnoses are not coded as if it exists for an outpatient visit.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">General Symptoms and Signs (R50–R69)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The block of codes for general symptoms and signs (R50–R69) classifies general symptoms that are not related to one specific body system. Category R56, Convulsions, not elsewhere classified, is subdivided to recognize different forms of seizures or convulsions not identified as epileptic. Two codes exist for febrile seizures. A <span class="CharOverride-2">complex febrile seizure</span> (code R56.01) is defined as a fever-associated seizure that is focal, prolonged (lasting more than 15 minutes), or recurs within 24 hours, or seizures in which only one side of the body is affected. These may also be described as “atypical” or “complicated” febrile seizures. Simple febrile seizures are ones that last less than 15 minutes and are without recurrence within the next 24 hours (or within the same febrile illness) (Holmes 2019).</p>
			<p class="Text">Any other fever-associated seizure that does not meet this definition is defined as a <span class="CharOverride-2">simple febrile seizure</span> (code R56.00). A febrile seizure that is not specified as simple or complex will also be coded to the R56.00 code. Another code is included for posttraumatic seizures (code R56.1). The last code under this category, R56.9, includes other or recurrent convulsions that are not related to fever and may also be described as “convulsive seizure or fit” in the diagnostic statement.</p>
			<span id="page577" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 577"></span>
			<p class="Text">Category R52, Pain, unspecified, is a symptom code for generalized pain or pain without specificity of site. This code would not be used if the pain is described as acute or chronic or if the patient has localized pain that would be coded to pain by anatomic site. This is a three-character code with no subdivisions.</p>
			<p class="Text">Category R68, Other general symptoms and signs, is subdivided to include conditions that do not fit in other body system categories. Examples of conditions in this category are codes R68.12, Fussy infant (baby); R68.11, Excessive crying of infant (baby); R68.81, Early satiety; and R68.83, chills (without fever).</p>

			<p class="Text">As stated previously, symptom and sign categories are frequently used in outpatient settings to indicate that the patient has a physical complaint for which a definitive diagnosis has not been established. It is possible that a symptom code might be used for an inpatient diagnosis when a reason for the complaint cannot be determined. In addition, symptom codes may be used as additional codes with an established diagnosis to describe the complete story of the patient’s illness if the symptom is not an integral or usual part of the disease.</p>

The diagnoses for the urgent care visit are R10.11, Right upper quadrant (abdominal) pain; R11.2, nausea with vomiting; and R55, Syncope. The acute appendicitis described as a possible condition is not coded in the outpatient setting.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Abnormal Findings (R70–R94)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Abnormal findings codes contain descriptors for nonspecific abnormal findings from laboratory, x-ray, pathologic, and other diagnostic tests. These nonspecific findings may be referred to as signs or clinical signs. Codes for nonspecific abnormal test results or findings may be found in the Alphabetic Index under such entries as the present condition or finding identified by a test (bacteremia, prediabetes, raised antibody titer) test name ASC-US or one of the following statements:</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-14">abnormal, abnormality, abnormalities</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">findings, abnormal, inconclusive, without diagnosis</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">elevated, elevation</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">high</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-15">low</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">positive</p>
			<p class="Text">Abnormal findings from laboratory, x-ray, pathologic, and other diagnostic results are not coded and reported unless the physician indicates their clinical significance. If the findings are outside the normal range and the physician has ordered other tests to evaluate the condition or has prescribed treatment, it is appropriate to ask the physician whether the diagnosis code(s) for the abnormal findings should be added.</p>
			<p class="Text">Often abnormal findings are the reason for additional testing to be performed on patients in the outpatient setting. For example, elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) (code R97.20) may be a reason for continued testing or monitoring of a patient. The code does not provide a specific diagnosis but indicates an abnormal finding for a specific organ. Abnormal findings recorded in the record may or may not be appropriate to code. If the coder notes an abnormal laboratory finding that appears to have triggered additional testing or therapy, the coder should ask the physician whether the abnormal finding is a clinically significant condition.</p>
			<p class="Text">On other occasions, the coder will notice abnormal findings on radiologic studies that may well be incidental to the patient’s current condition. For example, an elderly patient with <span id="page579" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 579"></span>congestive heart failure is given a chest x-ray. A finding of degenerative arthritis is noted in the radiologist’s conclusion, but no apparent treatment or further evaluation has occurred. It is unlikely that the arthritis should be coded as it is considered an incidental finding.</p>
			<p class="Text">The radiologist’s findings can be used to identify the specific site of a fracture when the attending or ordering physician’s diagnosis statement is nonspecific. For example, the attending physician writes, “Fracture, left tibia.” However, the radiologist describes the injury as a fracture of the shaft of the tibia. The coder may code S82.20-, Fracture, tibia, shaft, based on the specific findings of the radiologist.</p>
			<p class="Text">The radiologist’s findings may also be used to clarify an outpatient’s diagnosis or reason for services. For example, a patient comes to the hospital for an outpatient x-ray. The physician’s order for the x-ray is “possible kidney stones.” The radiologist’s statement on the radiology report is “bilateral nephrolithiasis.” Based on the fact that the radiologist is a physician, it is appropriate to code the calculus of the kidney as the patient’s diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Text">The title of category R92, Abnormal and inconclusive findings on diagnostic imaging of breast, includes the term “inconclusive.” This category includes findings that are considered inconclusive and not necessarily abnormal. For example, a routine mammogram may be considered inconclusive due to what is termed “dense breasts.” This is not an abnormal condition but a condition that may require further testing—for example, an ultrasound—to conclude that no malignant condition exists that cannot be found on the mammogram. The diagnosis of dense breast or inconclusive mammography is assigned code R92.2, Inconclusive mammogram.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding of Papanicolaou Test (Pap Smear) Findings (R87)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The coding of Papanicolaou tests (Pap smears) often involves the coding of nonspecific abnormal findings. Because the classification of abnormal Pap smears has become more specific in recent years, ICD-10-CM includes code options under subcategories R87.6–R87.9, Abnormal cytological, histological and other abnormal findings in specimens from female genital organs.</p>
			<p class="Text">The Bethesda System of Cytologic Examination is used by most of the laboratories in the United States and has been endorsed by national and international societies as the preferred method of reporting the results of abnormal Pap smears (Apgar et al. 2003). In ICD-10-CM, code R87.612 describes Pap smear of the cervix with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and code R87.613 describes Pap smear of the cervix with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Other codes describe Pap smear with cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test positive (R87.810), Pap smear of the cervix with cytologic evidence of malignancy (R87.614), and Pap smear with cervical low-risk HPV DNA test positive (R87.820). Another code describes an unsatisfactory cytologic smear of the cervix or an inadequate sample from the cervix (R87.615).</p>
			<p class="Text">The Excludes note for subcategory R87.61 refers the coder to other subcategories for confirmed dysplasia, CIN I–III, or carcinoma <span class="CharOverride-1">in situ</span> conditions.</p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The patient is a 40-year-old female who returns to her gynecologist’s office to review the results of her recent Pap smear. The physician stated the cytology report included the diagnosis of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion based on examination of cervical specimen submitted for study. The physician recommended that a colposcopy be performed in the following month to further investigate the abnormal findings of the Pap smear. The diagnosis code is R87.612, Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on cytologic smear of cervix.</p>
			<span id="page580" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 580"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Abnormal Tumor Markers (R97)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Testing has become common practice for elevations in TAA, antigens that are relatively restricted to tumor cells; in TSA, antigens unique to tumor cells; and in the diagnosis of and the follow-up care for many malignancies. A unique code for elevated PSA was created when this test became routine in the monitoring of prostate cancer. Many other TAA and TSA tests have become standard practice, and other elevated TAA codes are available for use: R97.0, Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); R97.1, Elevated cancer antigen 125 (CA 125); R97.20, Elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA); R97.21, Rising PSA following treatment for malignant neoplasm of prostate.</p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-19"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The 75-year-old male brought his physician’s order to the outpatient laboratory department of the hospital to complete a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) laboratory test. The laboratory used the diagnosis of “elevated PSA” as written by the doctor on the laboratory test order form to complete the claim for the lab test service: R97.20, Elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA).</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-18">Ill-Defined and Unknown Causes of Mortality (R99)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality section of Chapter 18 include death or unexplained death and other conditions that are unspecified causes of mortality. These codes should not be used when a more definitive diagnosis is available. Code R99 is likely to be used for the patient who is brought to the hospital emergency department or other facility but has appeared to die prior to arrival. There may or may not be resuscitation efforts depending on the individual circumstances. The reason for the death may not be known. The diagnosis in the record for this patient may be written as “dead on arrival” (DOA). The physician will pronounce the patient dead and document the date and time in the health record.</p>
			<p class="Text">Otherwise, the terminology of “death” is not a diagnosis. It is considered the healthcare outcome or the discharge disposition. The code R99 is not to be used on every health record when a patient expires. Instead, the cause of death and the underlying illness are coded on the health record. Code R99 is only used when the death is unexplained and there is no cause of death documented.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">ICD-10-PCS Procedure Coding to Investigate Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Diagnostic procedures may be performed to investigate symptoms, signs, and abnormal test findings. In the Medical and Surgical section, procedures falling under the root operations Excision or Drainage may be performed as diagnostic studies or biopsies. The seventh character for these procedures would be X to distinguish this procedure as diagnostic when the procedure is identified as a biopsy. Other diagnostic procedures from the Medical and Surgical section are also possible tests that can be performed to investigate symptoms and signs, for example, inspection procedures such as bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, and colonoscopy that may be performed without a companion procedure such as a biopsy.</p>
			<p class="Text">Diagnostic procedures also appear in other sections of the ICD-10-PCS classification system, for example, procedures in the Administration, Measurement and Monitoring, Imaging, and Nuclear Medicine sections. It would be up to the institution or provider to decide what procedures outside the Medical and Surgical section would be coded; just because there is a code for a procedure does not mean it requires coding unless the facility has coding guidelines that identify what procedures are coded.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Administration</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The codes in the Administration section identify procedures for putting in or on a therapeutic, prophylactic, protective, diagnostic, nutritional, or physiological substance. This section includes transfusions, infusions, and injections. The seven characters for the administration procedures are shown in table 21.1.</p>
