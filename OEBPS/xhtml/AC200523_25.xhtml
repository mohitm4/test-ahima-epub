			<p class="Text-flush">This text has included a thorough review of the characteristics and conventions of ICD-10-CM. <br />Classification systems are established for statistical comparison and research, and in the case of the ICD-10-CM classifications, the codes are used for reimbursement and other important purposes such as quality tracking and improvement. This chapter includes a brief discussion of some of the reimbursement purposes for coding; the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, Medicare payment review programs, present on admission, and medical necessity.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The <span class="CharOverride-1">hospital inpatient prospective payment system</span> (IPPS) is a method of payment undertaken by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to control the cost of inpatient acute-care hospital services to Medicare recipients. Title VI of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 established the prospective payment system (PPS) to provide payment to hospitals for each Medicare case at a set reimbursement rate, rather than on a fee-for-service or per-day basis (CMS 2023a). Under CMS, Medicare recipients must be over the age of <br />65 and/or identified with certain disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Medicare includes the following coverage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">Part A: inpatient hospital, skilled nursing, some home health</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Part B: medical insurance premium, physician services, outpatient hospital services, some home health, durable medical equipment</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Part C: Medicare + Choice (Medicare as an HMO product), or Medicare Advantage Plan</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">Part D: Prescription drug coverage (Medicare Interactive 2023)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-6">Medicaid is another type of coverage administered by the state governments under CMS and is based on income and resource shortfalls. Both Medicare and Medicaid include quality and medical necessity provisions. It is important to note that third-party payers and private insurance companies follow CMS’s lead in reimbursement; however, the major difference is using negotiated versus set base rates for hospitals. Base rates will be explained in detail below.</p>
			<p class="Text">Inpatient hospital payment rates are established before services are rendered and are based on <span class="CharOverride-1">diagnosis-related groups (DRGs)</span>. Since fiscal year 2008, Medicare adopted a severity-adjusted diagnosis-related group system called <span class="CharOverride-1">Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related </span><span class="CharOverride-1">Groups (MS-DRGs)</span>. This was the most drastic revision to the DRG system in 24 years. The goal of the new MS-DRG system was to significantly improve Medicare’s ability to recognize severity of illness in its inpatient hospital payments. The intent is to increase payments to hospitals for services provided to the sicker patient and decrease payments for treating less severely ill patients. There are up to three levels of severity in the MS-DRGs that reflect the differences in the patient’s condition based on additional diagnoses codes assigned:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">MS-DRGs with major complication or comorbidity (MCC), which reflect the highest level of severity. This level reflects the sickest patient with the highest level of severity and requires a significant amount of resources to treat both the principal diagnosis and the additional conditions the patient has.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span id="page729" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 729"></span>MS-DRG with complication or comorbidity (CC), which is the next level of severity. This is a mid-level degree of severity based on these secondary diagnoses and requires additional resources for treating the principal and additional diagnoses.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">MS-DRGs with no complication or comorbidity (non-CC), which do not significantly affect severity of illness and resource use. This means the patient did not have an additional condition that required significant additional resources other than what was needed to treat the condition the patient had (CMS 2019).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Both medical and surgical MS-DRGs may be influenced by a secondary diagnosis code (CMS 2023a). For example, if a patient had the principal diagnosis of heart failure, then the presence or the absence of a secondary diagnosis would determine the MS-DRG assigned. See table 25.1 for examples of the medical MS-DRGs for Heart Failure and Shock.</p>

			<p class="Text">MS-DRGs represent an inpatient classification system designed to categorize patients who are medically related with respect to diagnoses and treatment and who are statistically similar in their lengths of stay. Each DRG has a preset reimbursement amount that the hospital receives whenever the MS-DRG is assigned. Acute-care hospitals receive Medicare IPPS payments on a per discharge basis for Medicare beneficiaries—one payment per one inpatient hospital stay. All outpatient diagnostic services and admission-related therapeutic services provided by the same hospital on the day of the patient’s admission or within three days preceding the date of inpatient admission must be included on the inpatient hospital claim to Medicare and are paid as part of the MS-DRG payment. No separate payment is made for these outpatient services.</p>
			<p class="Text">The Medicare patient’s principal diagnosis and up to 24 additional diagnoses that include diagnoses that are recognized as major or other complication or comorbidity will determine the medical MS-DRG. If the patient had surgery or a significant procedure, this will impact the MS-DRG assignment as well. Up to 25 procedure codes may be reported on the inpatient claim to Medicare, and these will likely cause a surgical MS-DRG to be assigned. Each fiscal year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluates the composition of the MS-DRGs to determine if the DRG still includes clinically similar conditions that require similar amounts of resources to care for the patients. When the clinical and financial information about a particular MS-DRG proves that the group contains significantly different amounts of resources, CMS has the option to assign diagnosis and procedure codes to a different MS-DRG or create a new MS-DRG for a particular set of diagnoses or procedures.</p>

			<p class="Text">The base payment rates for each MS-DRG are determined from two basic sources. First, each MS-DRG is assigned a relative weight. The <span class="CharOverride-1">relative weight</span> represents the average resources required to care for cases in that particular MS-DRG relative to the national average of resources used to treat all Medicare cases. For example, consider how the relative weight of an MS-DRG represents the average resources required to care of a patient within a particular MS-DRG. MS-DRG 343, Appendectomy without complicated principal diagnosis, without CC/MCC, has a proposed FY 2023 weight of 1.0927. In comparison, MS-DRG 005, Liver <span id="page731" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 731"></span>Transplant with MCC or Intestinal Transplant, has a proposed FY 2023 weight of 11.4070. A liver transplant patient would take more than 10 times the resources to care for compared to the patient who had an appendectomy without a complicated diagnosis. On the other hand, if a patient was discharged with the final diagnosis of abortion and assigned to MS-DRG 770, Abortion, with a weight of 0.8658, it is expected that this patient would likely be treated medically for a short day and would require half the resources as the appendectomy patient. Each year, the relative weights of the MS-DRGs are updated to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and any other factors that may change the relative use of hospital resources.</p>
			<p class="Text">The second source that determines MS-DRG payment rate is the individual <span class="CharOverride-1">hospital’s payment rate</span> per case. This payment rate is based on a regional or national adjusted standardized amount that considers the type of hospital; designation of the hospital as large urban, other urban, or rural; and a wage index for the geographic area in which the hospital is located. This is called the base payment rate or standardized rate and is a dollar amount that includes a labor-related and non–labor-related portion. The labor-related portion is adjusted by the wage index for a geographic area to reflect the differences in the cost of employing individuals to work in the hospitals. The non-labor rate accounts for capital expenses and operating expenses that determine the cost of providing hospital services other than paying employees. The two factors together are called the hospital’s wage-adjusted standard payment rate or the <span class="CharOverride-1">hospital’s base rate</span>. By submitting a claim for the inpatient services with the financial charges and the diagnoses and procedure codes to the Medicare contractor responsible for processing claims, the payment process begins. Based on the coded data on the claim, the Medicare contractor assigns each case to a specific MS-DRG.</p>

			<p class="Text">Thus, the actual amount the hospital is reimbursed for each Medicare inpatient is determined by multiplying the hospital’s individual base rate by the relative weight of the DRG, less any applicable deductible amount.</p>
			<p class="Text">The formula for computing the hospital payment for each MS-DRG is as follows:</p>
			<p class="equation ParaOverride-11">MS-DRG Relative Weight × Hospital Base Rate = Hospital Payment</p>
			<p class="Text">For example, a hospital patient was assigned MS-DRG 236, Coronary bypass without cardiac catheterization without MCC. MS-DRG 236 has a proposed FY2023 relative weight of 4.0784. This hospital had a hospital base rate of $6,000. The hospital could expect the total payment for this patient to be $24,470.40.</p>
			<p class="Text">For any given patient in an MS-DRG, the hospital knows, in advance, the amount of reimbursement it will receive from Medicare. It is the responsibility of the hospital to ensure that its resource use is reasonably in line with the expected payment. In addition to the basic payment rate, Medicare provides for an additional payment for other factors related to a particular hospital’s business. If the hospital treats a high percentage of low-income patients, it receives a percentage add-on payment applied to the MS-DRG–adjusted base payment rate. Another scenario that qualifies a hospital to receive this additional payment is when a hospital is located in an urban setting with 100 or more beds and receives more than 30 percent of the hospital’s net revenue from state and other local government sources for indigent care. This add-on payment, known as the <span class="CharOverride-1">disproportionate share hospital (DSH)</span> adjustment, provides for a percentage increase in Medicare payments to hospitals that qualify under either of two statutory formulas designed to identify hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.</p>
			<p class="Text">Teaching hospitals with residents in approved residency programs receive what are called <span class="CharOverride-1">direct graduate medical education (DGME)</span> payments that represent the direct costs of operating a residency program, including paying the residents’ salaries and supervising physicians. In addition, an approved teaching hospital receives a percentage add-on payment for each Medicare discharge paid under IPPS. This is known as the <span class="CharOverride-1">indirect medical education (IME)</span> adjustment. This percentage varies, depending on the ratio of residents to the inpatient beds.</p>
			<span id="page732" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 732"></span>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Sole community hospitals (SCHs)</span> can receive an additional operating payment. SCHs are hospitals that are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">located at least 35 miles from another similar acute-care IPPS hospital;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">located in a rural setting located between 25 and 35 miles for another similar hospital and must meet one other criterion related to the admission patterns of the community residents;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">located in a rural setting but because of local topography or periods of prolonged severe weather conditions, the other like hospitals are inaccessible for at least 30 days in each of two out of three years; or</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">located in a rural setting and because of distance, posted speed limits, predictable weather conditions, the travel time between the hospital and the nearest like hospital is at least 45 minutes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-6">As the name of these hospitals implies, these hospitals are the sole source of healthcare in their area (CMS 2022). The defining legislation for Sole Community Hospitals is Section 1886(d)(5)(D)(iii) of the Social Security Act.</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Medicare-dependent hospitals (MDHs)</span> receive additional operating payments. An MDH is a rural hospital with 100 or fewer beds, is not a sole community hospital (SCH), and at least 60 percent of their discharges are Medicare patients as documented in at least two out of the last three most recent audited Medicare cost reporting periods for which there is a settled cost report (CMS 2023j). These hospitals are a major source of care for Medicare beneficiaries in their area. Together with SCHs, MDHs are afforded this special payment in order to maintain access to services for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
			<p class="Text">To assure the Medicare beneficiaries have access to high quality, but expensive healthcare, additional payments are made for what is called an <span class="CharOverride-1">outlier</span> or extremely costly care. The costs incurred by a hospital for a Medicare beneficiary are evaluated to determine whether the hospital is eligible for an additional payment as an outlier case. A fixed loss amount is set each year. Hospitals are paid 80 percent of their costs above the fixed loss threshold and 90 percent of costs above the outlier threshold for burn patients (CMS 2023j). This additional payment is designed to protect the hospital from large financial losses due to unusually expensive cases. Any outlier payment due is added to the MS-DRG–adjusted base payment rate, plus any DSH, IME, and medical service add-on adjustments.</p>

			<p class="Text">The <span class="CharOverride-1">discharge disposition</span> of a patient, or where the patient goes after discharge from the hospital, has an impact on the hospital’s payment for the inpatient admission. MS-DRG payments are reduced if the patient is transferred to another acute-care hospital that receives IPPS payments or, for certain MS-DRGs, is transferred to another healthcare setting where Medicare payments are made for the patient’s continued care. These <span class="CharOverride-1">post–acute-care settings</span> are healthcare settings where a patient receives healthcare services after his or her discharge <span id="page733" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 733"></span>from an acute-care hospital including long-term care hospitals, rehabilitation or psychiatric hospitals, units in acute-care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, cancer hospitals, or children’s hospitals. Hospitals receive a reduced payment for an IPPS patient who is transferred to another acute-care hospital or to one of the post–acute-care settings.</p>
			<p class="Text">Additional payment adjustments occur with higher cost outlier cases and for new medical services and technologies. For higher cost outlier cases, an additional payment that is equal to 80 percent of the difference between the hospital’s cost for the encounter and the DRG payment plus the threshold amount. Additionally, when new medical services or technologies are provided to Medicare beneficiaries, an additional amount is provided of the DRG payment plus 50 percent of the technology or service cost once established.</p>

			<p class="Text">CMS evaluates the Medicare IPPS annually. CMS’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published in the <span class="CharOverride-2">Federal Register</span> in late April or early May each year. This notice, on which the public may comment, will announce proposed ICD-10-CM/PCS code changes after October 1st, as well as proposed revisions to the MS-DRG system each year. CMS’s Final Rule announcing final revisions to the IPPS, including the MS-DRG system, is published in the <span class="CharOverride-2">Federal Register</span> in July or August and the changes become effective October 1 each year.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Reimbursement</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Now that we know that MS-DRGs are divided into Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs), it is important to make a closer connection to ICD-10-CM. When coding for ICD-10-CM, the principle diagnosis determines the MDC (remembering that if the service was for a procedure, <br />the procedure determines either the medical or surgical MS-DRG). The use of electronic health records has allowed for grouper software or the use of Encoders with grouper software to assign an MS-DRG based on the code selection. In order to properly code, and ultimately get to the correct MS-DRG for reimbursement, the coder should rely on the <span class="CharOverride-2">Coding Clinic</span> and coding guidelines as tools to remain current with changes to the MS-DRG system. Changes are published in the <span class="CharOverride-2">Federal Register</span> and can include new, deleted, or revised codes, changes to MS-DRG relative weights, and average length of stay definitions and criteria. Another important impact on MS-DRGs includes the complications and comorbidities as described above.</p>

			<p class="Text">A good rule of thumb is to remember that a complication includes a condition that arises during hospitalization, making it not present on admission (POA). On the other hand, a comorbidity is a pre-existing condition and would be considered POA. The Deficit Reduction Act identified that diagnoses that are considered POA must be identified for reimbursement purposes. According to CMS (2023j), POA general reporting requirements include:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">All claims involving inpatient admissions mandate the collection of POA</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">POA must be present at the time of an inpatient admission; including conditions that develop during an outpatient encounter (ED, observation, or outpatient surgery)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">POA is assigned to the principle and secondary diagnosis</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">Issues with unclear documentation for POA must be resolved by the provider</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-6">A condition that is not POA on admission, but manifests during the stay is considered a hospital-acquired condition (HAC). HACs are considered to be preventable conditions by CMS. In these cases, the hospitals do not receive the higher payment for cases when conditions were acquired during the hospitalization. The case gets paid as though the secondary diagnosis is non-existent.</p>
			<span id="page734" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 734"></span>
			<p class="Text">Additionally, an adjustment is made for MS-DRG payment when excess readmissions are identified. A readmission ratio measures readmissions compared to the national averages of the same conditions. For example, as part of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) list of annual conditions, coronary artery bypass graft surgery was included in the program. According to CMS (2023j), a readmission refers to an admission, paid via IPPS, within 30 days of a discharge from the same or other acute care hospital.</p>
			<p class="Text">The MS-DRG system also allows inpatient hospitals to measure their case-mix index. In other words, a hospital’s case-mix is a direct measure of the resource consumption or cost of providing care (CMS 2023b). A complex case mix identifies that the hospital patients are consuming more resources, and thus require a higher cost of care. However, just because the case mix is complex does not mean that the hospital treats patients having a greater severity of illness (SI). SI must be included on the hospitals case mix via the inclusion of CCs and MCCs.</p>
			<p class="Text">The case mix index can ultimately be impacted by the accuracy of a provider’s clinical documentation to validate each inpatient service day medical necessity. Reimbursement <br />may only be provided for services that meet the criteria of medical necessity. Medically necessary services include those that are “proper and needed for the diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions, are provided for the diagnosis, direct care, and treatment of the medical <br />condition, and meet the standards of good medical practice in the area” (CMS 2023c). Policies that outline the criteria for what is deemed medically necessary include both National Coverage determinations (NCDs) and Local Coverage determinations (LCDs). Improved clinical documentation and response rates to coder queries can result in a positive increase of CMI.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Coding for Medical Necessity</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Three factors help define the <span class="Bold _idGenCharOverride-1">medical necessity</span> of a diagnostic test, procedure, or treatment (42 CFR 405.500 1995):</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-12"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">1.</span>&#9;The likelihood that a proposed healthcare service will have a reasonable beneficial effect on the patient’s physical condition and quality of life at a specific point in his or her illness or lifetime.</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">2.</span>&#9;Healthcare services and supplies that are proven or acknowledged to be effective in the diagnosis, treatment, cure, or relief of a health condition, illness, injury, disease, or its symptoms and are consistent with the community’s accepted standard of care. Under medical necessity, only those services, procedures, and patient care warranted by the patient’s condition are provided.</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">3.</span>&#9;The concept that procedures are only reimbursed as a covered benefit when they are performed for a specific diagnosis or specified frequency.</p>
			<p class="Text">Accurate ICD-10-CM diagnosis coding is essential to establishing the medical necessity of a particular service as required by Medicare’s reasonable and necessary medical coverage policies. Other third-party payers also want to know the reason for the service before payment is determined. MACs that process Part A and Part B Medicare claims may develop local coverage determinations (LCDs). These policies ensure that claims submitted for certain services—typically outpatient services—have been deemed reasonable and necessary for the patient’s condition. National coverage determinations (NCDs) also exist for other diagnostic and therapeutic services including many laboratory tests, for which Medicare payment is contingent on a particular condition being established as the reason the test was ordered.</p>
			<span id="page735" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 735"></span>
			<p class="Text">The coder must be certain that documentation contains all of the reasons why the physician ordered a diagnostic or therapeutic service. Then the coder must assign all of the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for the claim to be reviewed accurately for medical necessity and paid appropriately. The requirements for determining medical necessity have moved the coding personnel outside the traditional HIM department into hospitals’ emergency departments, admitting or registration or access departments, central scheduling centers, and a variety of clinical departments performing many outpatient services, such as radiology and laboratory.</p>
			<p class="Text">The need to know if a patient’s condition meets the medical necessity requirements of a particular service is essential prior to issuing an <span class="CharOverride-1">advance beneficiary notice (ABN)</span> (CMS 2023d). An ABN is a statement signed by the patient when he or she is notified by the provider, prior to a service or procedure being performed, that Medicare may not reimburse the provider for the service, whereupon the patient indicates that he or she will be responsible for any charges. Medical necessity processing has brought the coding function closer to the point of care and, in some institutions, improved the documentation related to the reasons for outpatient therapy and testing services.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Adjustment</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Beginning in 2012, IPPS payments started to reflect applicable adjustments based on overall performance on a set of quality measures. The Hospital VBP Program allows organizations to earn back more than, all of, or less than the applicable percent reduction for a given year (CMS 2023k). The VBP program applies to participating acute IPPS hospitals with a few exceptions. The incentive adjustments are paid on a claim-by-claim basis with the adjustment factor based on the hospital’s Total Performance Score. The measure set includes Clinical Outcomes (25%), Person and Community Engagement (25%), Safety (25%), and Efficiency and Cost Reduction (25%). According to CMS (2023l), FY 2021 dollars will incentive payments based on a hospital’s Total Performance Score (TPS). FY 2021 available pool for VBP incentives will be approximately 1.9 billion. The hospital VBP program adjusts payments to hospitals under the IPPS based on the quality of care they deliver.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Medicare Review Programs</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">CMS reviews acute IPPS and long-term care hospital (LTCH) records for payment purposes. Documentation and code assignment must be accurate and specific. CMS contracts with Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to conduct medical and coding reviews to prevent improper payment of inpatient hospital claims. This review is done to ensure that billed items or services are covered and are reasonable and necessary as specified in section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (CMS 2023e).</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Quality Improvement Organizations</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">CMS contracts with one or more organizations in each state or region to serve as that area’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Quality Improvement Organization (QIO)</span>. QIOs are not-for-profit private organizations staffed by health quality experts, clinicians, and consumers organized to improve the care delivered to people with Medicare. QIOs’ focus is on improving the quality of healthcare by working with medical providers through quality improvement activities. Originally CMS contracted with a QIO for a three-year period of time with an agreement called a scope of work as to what services the QIO will provide to Medicare beneficiaries or on their behalf (CMS 2023f).</p>
			<p class="Text">Medicare contracts with QIOs to promote better patient care, better population health, and lower healthcare costs through improvement in the delivery of healthcare services. As a result, QIOs focus their work on the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">Improving quality of care for beneficiaries;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Protecting the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund. Ensure that Medicare only pays for services that are reasonable and necessary for the Medicare beneficiary and is provided in the most appropriate setting;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Protecting beneficiaries by performing expedited coverage reviews of appeals or requests, such as beneficiary complaints; provider-based notice appeals; violations of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA); and other related responsibilities as articulated in QIO-related law. An expedited coverage review is usually a request from the Medicare patient to extend their hospital stay when their physician and hospital has determined the patient should be discharged from the hospital and the patient disagrees with the discharge. The QIO attempts to resolve these discharge disputes between the patient and the physician and hospital.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Reviewing beneficiaries’ appeals in response to provider-based notices;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">Reviewing allegations of violations of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) (CMS 2023f)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">CMS has restructured its QIO Program over the last several years to enhance its ability to improve the quality of medical services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. The new program maximizes learning and collaborating in improving care by spreading new effective practices and models of care among clinicians. The QIOs are focused on partnering with CMS to meet the goals of the CMS quality strategy and deliver program values to the Medicare population and taxpayers. In the redesign of the QIO programs, CMS separated case review from quality improvement activities. The prior three-year contracts were extended to five-year contracts. CMS removed the restriction of only one QIO entity in each state or region and broadened <span id="page737" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 737"></span>CMS considerations of the type of entities that could perform the work. The result has been that two groups of QIO organizations exist in a state or a region. The first type are called Beneficiary and Family-Centered Care (BFCC) QIOs and handle beneficiary complaints, quality of care reviews, EMTALA reviews, and other types of case reviews. The second group of QIOs, Quality Innovation Network (QIN) QIOs, partner with healthcare providers on data-driven projects to improve patient safety, reduce harm, and improve clinical care at the local community level. In addition, CMS established a website, QualityNet, to provide healthcare quality improvement news, references, reporting tools, and data resources used by healthcare providers and only. QualityNet provides secure communication and healthcare quality data exchange between QIOs and clinicians (CMS 2023g).</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Medicare Administrative Contractors</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Ever since Medicare started in 1966, CMS has contracted with private healthcare insurance companies to process medical claims for Medicare beneficiaries. For many years, these entities were known as Part A Fiscal Intermediaries (FI) and Part B carriers. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 directed CMS to replace the Part A FIs and Part B carriers with MACs (CMS 2023h).</p>
			<p class="Text">CMS awards Medicare Part A and Part B claims processing contracts through a competitive bidding process (previously completed by fiscal intermediaries and carriers) to <span class="CharOverride-1">Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)</span>. There are currently 12 Part A and Part B MACs and 4 durable medical equipment (DME) MACs that processed Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims for the great majority of the total Medicare beneficiary population (CMS 2023i).</p>
			<p class="Text">MACs process Part A and Part B Medicare FFS claims to make payments to providers. They also enroll physicians and others as providers into the Medicare FFS program. The MACs work with providers, both hospitals and clinicians, to handle reimbursement issues, audit provider cost reports, respond to providers questions, and educate the providers about Medicare FFS billing requirements. In addition, the MACs establish local coverage determination (LCD) policies to determine when an outpatient service is reasonable and necessary for a Medicare beneficiary’s medical condition. The MACs perform reviews of medical records on selected claims for coding, billing, and medical necessity requirements.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Comprehensive Error Rate Testing Program</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The <span class="CharOverride-1">Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT)</span> contractor reviews claims for the purpose of producing a national Medicare fee-for-service payment error rate. There is a rate calculated for inpatient hospitals, durable medical equipment, physicians, labs, ambulance, and noninpatient hospital facilities. The CERT contractor performs reviews on a post-payment basis. In order to determine the error rate by which Medicare MACs are paying acute IPPS hospital and LTCH claims appropriately, the review is conducted in accordance with coverage, coding, and medical necessity guidelines. In order to produce a national Medicare fee-for-service payment error rate, the CERT contractor’s clinical staff review the claim with the submitted medical record to determine if the Medicare claim submitted was coded correctly, met medical necessity requirements, and was paid appropriately. A statistically valid random sample of Medicare claims are reviewed on a post-payment basis (CMS 2023l).</p>
			<p class="Text">Each hospital is notified when a claim has been selected for review in slightly different ways, depending on the review entity. The CERT contractor notifies providers that a claim is <span id="page738" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 738"></span>selected for CERT review via letter. The hospital provides copies of the selected reviews by&#160;mail or as directed to the CERT contractor. The provider must submit a copy of the record by the date requested. The MAC reviews the claim and makes any necessary payment adjustments based on the review. The provider has the right to appeal the decision made by the CERT contractor through an established procedure. The CERT program provides Medicare with two measurements: how well the provider codes and submits the claim and how well the MAC educates the provider community on how to submit claims correctly (CMS 2023e).</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Recovery Audit Program Contractors</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Despite the efforts of QIOs and other initiatives that CMS has undertaken, there are concerns that the Medicare Trust Fund may not be adequately protected against improper payments. Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which was designed to enhance and support Medicare’s current efforts (MMA 2003).</p>
			<p class="Text">Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a three-year demonstration project using <span class="CharOverride-1">Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs)</span> to detect and correct improper payments in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the PAC program permanent and required the program be expanded to all 50 states (CMS 2021).</p>
			<p class="Text">The demonstration project began in 2005 and ended in 2008 with three contractors focusing on Medicare beneficiaries’ healthcare claims in three states with large numbers of Medicare beneficiaries: New York, Florida, and California. The demonstration project allowed Medicare to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the program in order to make improvements in the RAC program. Congress made the program permanent and CMS expanded the program to all states in 2010. The types of services included in RAC reviews are hospital inpatient admission, outpatient hospital visits, physician visits, skilled nursing facility admissions, home health services, and durable medical equipment provided.</p>
			<p class="Text">The RACs performed reviews of medical records with the corresponding Medicare claims to</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">Detect improper Medicare payments, including both underpayments and overpayments</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">Correct improper Medicare payments</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">The types of errors found by the RACs that resulted in improper payments may result from</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">Incorrect payment amounts calculated by the payer (MAC, FI, or Carrier)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Noncovered services including services that are not reasonable and necessary under Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act, often referred to as not “medically necessary.”</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Incorrectly coded services that result in incorrect DRGs</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">Duplicate services billed by and paid to a provider</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">To be more specific, the RACs attributed the improper payments to six reasons as a result of their reviews:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-2">Medically unnecessary services paid for (74 percent)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Insufficient documentation to justify payment (12.2 percent)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span id="page739" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 739"></span>Underpayment due to incorrect coding (7.1 percent)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">Overpayment due to incorrect coding (5.1 percent)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">No documentation to justify payment (1.2 percent)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-5">Other reasons (0.5 percent) (CMS 2019)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Each RAC is responsible for identifying overpayment and underpayments in approximately one-quarter of the country (CMS 2023b).</p>
			<p class="Text">RAC contractors review claims on a post-payment basis for potential overpayments and underpayments by the MAC. The reviews are based on the CMS regulations for billing, medical necessity, coverage determinations, and coding guidelines. The RAC contractors do not develop their own billing and coding policies. The claims are selected based on focused areas of review for both inpatient and outpatient records. Inpatient records are selected based on the specific MS-DRGs targeted for review based on the RAC contractor’s past experience with coding and sequencing errors. The inpatient record reviews are referred to as complex reviews. Outpatient records are selected based on experience primarily with billing errors using CPT/HCPCS codes. Each hospital is notified when a claim has been selected for review with an “Additional Documentation Request” sent to the RAC coordinator at the hospital. The hospital must submit the record for each case identified for a review within a specified period of time. If the record is not submitted on a timely basis, the claim will be delayed and the payment made previously will be collected. The RAC contractor also performs what is called automated reviews strictly on the submitted outpatient claims based on experience with the use of CPT/HCPCS codes and the number of units charged for a particular procedure code using proprietary software. The RAC can only review claims submitted in the past three years.</p>
			<p class="Text">If a particular record has been reviewed by another entity, such as the QIO or CERT contractor, the RAC contractor will not review the same case. When the RAC concludes that a billing or coding error has been made with an improper payment made, it will notify the FI/MAC to adjust the claim and recoup the payment from the providers. The error may be either an overpayment or an underpayment to the provider. The provider is notified of the finding and has the opportunity to appeal following an established appeal process that involves submitting documentation to support the provider’s disagreement with the RAC decision. The appeals process used for the RAC is the same for all providers who want to appeal a Medicare’s claim decision (CMS 2021). There are five levels of appeals:</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-12"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">1.</span>&#9;First level of appeal is submitted to the claims processing contractors such as a Medicare carrier, fiscal intermediary (FI), or Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC).</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">2.</span>&#9;Second level of appeal is submitted to a qualified independent contractor (QIC).</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">3.</span>&#9;Third level of appeal is submitted to an administrative law judge (ALJ) in the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals.</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-13"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">4.</span>&#9;Fourth level of appeal is submitted to the Medicare Appeals Council.</p>
			<p class="Num-list-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">5.</span>&#9;Fifth level of appeal is submitted for a judicial review through the Federal District Court review process.</p>
			<p class="Text">The examination of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS coding has been a major area of focus for the RACs because the diagnosis and procedure codes create the MS-DRGs, which are the basis <span id="page740" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 740"></span>of payment for acute-care hospitals. When ICD-10-CM coding is implemented, the examination of these codes will be the focus of RAC reviews for reimbursement purposes. ICD-10-CM/PCS <br />and CPT coding in other healthcare organizations, such as rehabilitation hospitals and units and <br />physician offices, determine reimbursement to the providers and therefore are a focus of attention during these providers’ reviews. Certified coders are employed by RACs to perform coding reviews.</p>
			<p class="Text">The mission of the RAC program is to identify and correct Medicare and Medicaid improper payments. Since the program’s inception, improper payments have been found for items and services that do not meet Medicare’s coverage and medical necessity policies. Other payments were made in error based on the record being incorrectly coded. Finally, payments for services were found to be made in error based on the supporting documentation submitted that did not support the ordered service. An overpayment results in money collected from the provider paid by Medicare. An underpayment is made to the provider when the review determines the provider was owed additional money. CMS is obligated to provide a summary report to Congress each year about the RAC activities. The “Recovery Auditing in Medicare for Fiscal Year 2014, FY 2014 Report to Congress as Required by Section 1893(h) of the Social Security Act” provides a comprehensive review of the performance of the RACs in identifying the savings to the Medicare program that were accomplished (CMS 2023j).</p>

			<p class="_-hd">OIG Work Plan</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has the mission to protect DHHS program integrity as well as protect the program beneficiaries. The OIG releases annual plans to set priorities and emerging issues which include projects, evaluations, and audits to be addressed during the fiscal year by the OIG’s Office of Audit Services and Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OIG 2023). A more recent care delivery and Medicare financing model is the Accountable Care Organization (ACO). A few of the ACO programs included in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) are the Medicare shared savings program, advance payment ACO model and pioneer ACO model (OIG 2001). These models form networks that coordinate patient care. When care is provided more efficiently, the organizations become eligible for bonuses and make more when they keep their patients healthy. These networks share both the financial and medical responsibility of providing high quality and coordinated care to patients.</p>
