			<p class="Text ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-1">Chapter 5, Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (F01–F99), allows for more specific coding of these conditions consistent with the language of behavioral health and substance abuse services as documented in health and client records today. For example, mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10–F19) include an extensive number of codes that link the substance involved (alcohol or specific drug) with the specific disorder caused by it. For instance, code F14.280 identifies cocaine dependence with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder. The Index to Diseases and Injuries provides access to these </span><span class="CharOverride-1">codes under the main term “dependence,” with the substance and subterms beneath it to iden</span><span class="CharOverride-1">tify the behavioral disturbance associated with the substance.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">There are unique codes for alcohol and drug use (not specified as abuse or dependence), and abuse and dependence, so careful review of the documentation is required. A history of drug or alcohol dependence is coded as “in remission,” but the diagnosis of history or in remission requires the provider’s clinical judgment and must be specifically documented in the patient’s record. Further, there are combination codes for drug and alcohol use and associated conditions, such as withdrawal, sleep disorders, or psychosis. Under the category F10, there is a “use additional code” note for blood alcohol level (Y90.-), if applicable. Blood alcohol level can be indexed in the External Cause of Injuries Index.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-7"><span class="Bold-italic CharOverride-3">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision</span><span class="Bold CharOverride-3"> (DSM-5-TR)</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a </span><span class="CharOverride-1">nomenclature developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to standardize the diagnostic process for patients with psychiatric disorders (APA 2023c). DSM-5-TR incorporates the Chapter 5 ICD-10-CM codes. Because the DSM-5-TR diagnostic codes are limited to </span><span class="CharOverride-1">codes </span><span class="CharOverride-1">in the ICD system, new DSM-5-TR disorders are assigned to the best available ICD codes. Previous editions of </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-3">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> and ICD-9-CM used the same codes. Currently, multiple DSM-5-TR disorders are sometimes assigned to the same ICD code, which  is unavoidable because the selection of diagnostic codes in DSM-5-TR is limited to those already included in ICD-10-CM. It was expected that DSM-5 (the edition previous to DSM-5-TR) and ICD-10-CM would be available at the same time in May 2013 when DSM-5 was published. Since ICD-10-CM was delayed until October 2015, DSM-5 used ICD-9-CM codes. The ICD-10-CM codes are now shown in parentheses in the DSM-5-TR book following the DSM-5-TR disorder. The names connected with the ICD-10-CM codes </span><span class="CharOverride-1">sometimes do not match the DSM-5-TR name. For example, the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder in DSM-5-TR is classified to in ICD-10-CM as dysthymic disorder. The APA continues to work with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to include new DSM-5-TR terms in ICD-10-CM. The APA websites provide resources about the DSM-5-TR classification for mental disorders (APA 2023a; APA 2023b).</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-1">The purpose of DSM-5-TR is to provide clear descriptions of diagnostic categories that allow clinicians and investigators to diagnose, communicate about, study, and treat people with various mental disorders. Keep in mind that coders must assign diagnosis codes based on health record documentation by a provider who is legally qualified to render a medical diagnosis. DSM-5-TR uses the codes within ICD-10-CM for all mental disorders, including personality &#173;disorders and intellectual disabilities, but the ICD system does not contain the detailed descriptions of how to diagnose these conditions as used by the psychiatrists and mental health <br />practitioners. The GP v-5 book contains dual codes for every psychiatric diagnosis to account for the ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. The inclusion of ICD-10-CM codes in the DSM-5-TR code book allows the physician or practitioner to assign valid ICD-10-CM codes for services after October 1, 2015, for the purposes of proper billing and insurance claims (APA 2023c).</span></p>

Assign the diagnosis code for the medical conditions as directed by the Alphabetical Index along with the appropriate psychoactive substance use, abuse or dependence code. For example, for alcoholic pancreatitis due to alcohol dependence, assign the appropriate code from subcategory K85.2, Alcohol induced acute pancreatitis, and the appropriate code from subcategory F10.2, such as code F10.20, Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated.

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-14">A code from category Y90, Evidence of alcohol involvement determined by blood alcohol level, may be assigned when this information is documented and the patient’s provider has documented a condition classifiable to category F10, Alcohol related disorders.

For patients with documented factitious disorder on self or Munchausen’s syndrome, assign the appropriate code from subcategory F68.1-, Factitious disorder imposed on self.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-14">Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a disorder in which a caregiver (perpetrator) falsely reports or causes an illness or injury in another person (victim) under his or her care, such as a child, an elderly adult, or a person who has a disability. The condition is also referred to as “factitious disorder imposed on another” or “factitious disorder by proxy.” The perpetrator, not the victim, receives this diagnosis. Assign code F68.A, Factitious disorder imposed on another, to the perpetrator’s record. For the victim of a patient suffering from MSBP, assign the appropriate code from categories T74, Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, confirmed, or T76, Adult and child abuse, neglect and other maltreatment, suspected. </p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-12">The ICD-10-CM classifies dementia (categories F01, F02, and F03) on the basis of the etiology and severity (unspecified, mild, moderate or severe). Selection of the appropriate severity level requires the provider’s clinical judgment and codes should be assigned only on the basis of provider documentation (as defined in the <span class="CharOverride-5">Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>), unless otherwise instructed by the classification. If the documentation does not provide information about the severity of the dementia, assign the appropriate code for unspecified severity. </p>

			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-1">The codes in this chapter include mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders, including disorders of psychological development, but exclude symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical laboratory findings (R00–R99). Chapter 5 of ICD-10-CM does not contain symptoms and signs that might be attributed to a mental or behavioral disorder. For example, category R25, Abnormal involuntary movements, contains symptoms of abnormal head movements, twitching, or tremors. However, when these symptoms are caused by conditions such as stereotyped movement disorders or tic disorders, the conditions are coded in categories F95 and F98 in Chapter 5 of ICD-10-CM.</span></p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-1">Code F41.1 classifies </span><span class="CharOverride-8">generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. This condition is usually diagnosed in patients who are excessively worried about many things even when there is little to no reason to worry about them. The patients are very anxious about activities of daily life. They expect things will go poorly for them, and this keeps them from doing normal everyday tasks. GAD may be an inherited condition. It may develop slowly, often starting during the teen years or early adult life. Symptoms get better and worse over time and are often severe during times of stress. Better treatments have been developed as researchers learn more about fear and anxiety as it is produced in the brain. The condition is first suspected in a patient who complains about headaches, stomach and muscle aches, unexplained pain, and difficulty sleeping with feeling tired all the time. It is hard to diagnose as it develops slowly and may take time to be diagnosed while other causes are ruled out. Patients worry about everyday things, have trouble controlling their constant worries, have a hard time concentrating in school and on the job, and are not able to relax. GAD is usually treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. Cognitive behavior therapy is often useful for the patient by teaching the patient different ways to think, behave, and react to situations that they worry about. Two types of medications that may be beneficial include antianxiety medications and antidepressants (NLM 2023c).</span></p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-1">An </span><span class="CharOverride-8">eating disorder</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is an illness that causes disturbances in eating, such as consuming very small amounts of food or consuming excessive amounts of food. A person with an eating disorder usually has severe concerns about his or her body weight or appearance. Eating disorders frequently begin during teen and young adult years but may also start in childhood or later in life. Common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. These conditions are treatable medical and mental illnesses. Frequently, the conditions coexist with other mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. If a patient does not seek or receive treatment, the conditions can be life threatening. Some patients who do not continue their treatment are frequently hospitalized. Patients with anorexia nervosa require hospital care because of severe metabolic disorder and nutritional deficiencies that result from the condition that make the individual very ill. ICD-10-CM classifies the <span id="page228" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 228"></span>various forms of eating disorders that exist. Code F50.01, Anorexia nervosa restricting type, and code F50.02, anorexia nervosa binge eating/purging type are available to classify the patient. Other codes exist for bulimia nervosa (F50.2), other eating disorders (F50.8), and unspecified types of eating disorders (F50.9) in ICD-10-CM (NLM 2023d).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM provides a block of codes for disorders of adult personality and behavior <br />(F60–F69). One example of a condition classified with a code from this section is </span><span class="CharOverride-8">borderline personality disorder</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, code F60.3. This is a serious mental illness marked by unstable moods with difficulty in controlling behavior and maintaining positive interpersonal relationships. Most people who suffer from borderline personality disorder have problems regulating their emotions and thoughts and exhibit impulsive and reckless behavior. As a result, the patients have unstable relationships with other people including multiple marriages and alienating friends. Patients with this disorder also have other mental health illnesses such as &#173;depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders. The condition is difficult to identify and often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Borderline personality disorder can be treated with different types of psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and schema-focused therapy. It is important for the therapy to be effective, so the patient must get along with and trust the therapist; otherwise the patient often abandons the &#173;treatment. Unfortunately, there are no medications recognized as effective to treat the condition. However, some patients benefit from medications to treat their symptoms of anxiety, depression, and aggression (NIH 2023).</span></p>

The phrase intellectual disabilities is used to describe a person’s ability to learn and function at an expected level for his or her age in the activities of daily life. The level of intellectual disability can vary for both children and adults with this condition. Some individuals have very minor problems, while others are severely disabled by the lack of ability to function at a normal level. The intellectual disabilities can be coded according to the severity of the disability as described by the physician as mild (F70), moderate (F71), profound (F72), severe (F73), or if the patient has other intellectual disability (F78) or if simply stated the patient has an intellectual disability that is coded to an unspecified code (F79).
