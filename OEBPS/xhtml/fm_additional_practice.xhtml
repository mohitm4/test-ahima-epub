            end of each chapter, AHIMA Press also offers a student workbook, <span class="italic CharOverride-16">Basic

            Edition, by Brooke Palkie, ED, RHIA, FAHIMA, and Stacey Walraven, RHIA, CDIP, CCS, COC, CHTS-TR.</p>
        <p class="TOC_FM ParaOverride-16">This resource contains ICD-10-CM coding exercises related to each chapter of
            Basic ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Coding. Basic ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Coding Exercises provides the student
            with the next level of coding practiceâ€”that is, coding from case studies <br />or scenarios instead of
            one-line diagnostic or procedural statements. Basic ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Coding Exercises can be used as
            a student workbook in conjunction with this textbook for the lab portion of a coding course or as a text for
            a coding practicum or lab course, or can be used for independent study for skill building.</p>
        <p class="TOC_FM ParaOverride-16">Readers who are interested in gaining more hands-on practice coding in
            ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS should refer to the AHIMA bookstore at https://my.ahima.org/search/books for all
            the available ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS publications.</p>
