Laterality is also part of the code’s description, such as right upper limb, left lower limb, and such. Combination codes are included; for example, the codes for decubitus ulcers represent the site, the laterality, and the stage of the ulcer all in one code.

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-28">Cutaneous Abscess, Cellulitis and Acute Lymphangitis (L02–L03)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-3">Cellulitis</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is an acute inflammation of a localized area of subcutaneous tissue (Stedman 2012, 296–297). Predisposing conditions are open wounds, ulcerations, tinea pedis, and dermatitis, but these conditions need not be present for cellulitis to occur. Physical findings of cellulitis reveal red, hot skin with edema at the site of the infection. The area is tender, and the skin surface has a </span><span class="CharOverride-2">peau d’orange</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> (skin of an orange) appearance with ill-defined borders. Nearby lymph nodes often become inflamed.</span></p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-1">A cutaneous or subcutaneous </span><span class="CharOverride-3">abscess</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is a circumscribed collection of purulent material or pus appearing in an acute or chronic localized infection, caused by tissue destruction and associated with swelling, pain, and other signs of inflammation, such as erythema (Stedman 2012, 7). These abscesses usually follow skin trauma, and the organisms isolated are typically bacterial infection indigenous to the skin of the involved area. Abscesses may occur internally in tissues, organs, and confined spaces. An abscess begins as cellulitis. Cellulitis will clear within a few days with antibiotic treatment. Although drainage of abscesses may occur spontaneously, some abscesses may require incision and drainage, and possibly antibiotic therapy.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-3">Lymphangitis</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is the inflammation of lymphatic vessels or channels of the lymph system (Dorland 2012, 1083). These lymph vessels are located superficially under the skin. </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Streptococcus</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> bacteria are the common cause of lymphangitis. The bacteria usually invade the lymph vessels through openings in the skin caused by abrasions, lacerations, or skin infections. Symptoms of lymphangitis include warm, tender, red streaks on the affected area. The lymph vessels are warm, tender, and enlarged near the original injury, which could be a minor skin wound. It is important to treat lymphangitis quickly as there is the possibility that bacteria could spread quickly through the lymph system to other parts of the body. A related term that is used to describe a similar inflammation <span id="page415" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 415"></span>is lymphadenitis, that is, an inflammation of the one or more lymph nodes. Given the similar spelling of the two conditions, coders must be careful not to confuse and code the two conditions incorrectly.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM classifies cellulitis and acute lymphangitis to the category code L03. The category code is subdivided to fourth-character subcategories that identify the site, such as finger and toe, other parts of limb, face and neck, trunk, and other sites. Within the fourth character, there are the fifth-character codes that separate the two conditions—a set of codes for cellulitis and another set for lymphangitis. The sixth-character code identifies the condition, cellulitis or lymphangitis, and the anatomic site including laterality. An additional code should be assigned to identify the organism involved.</span></p>

It is an area of localized edema caused by dilatation and increased capillary permeability with wheals. It is also </span><span class="CharOverride-1">called hives (Dorland 2012, 2011). Physicians suspect hives or urticaria to be due to hypersensitiv</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ity to food or drugs and insect bites among other triggers. Urticaria develops when natural chemicals including histamines are released in the skin as an allergic reaction to something but can also occur due to a nonallergic cause such as an autoimmune disease. Urticaria usually resolves quickly in less than 24 hours. The best treatment is to find the cause and eliminate contact with it. Persistent urticaria is usually treated with over-the-counter antihistamine topical ointments or creams. When hives or urticaria are present with swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat or any other symptoms that are accompanied by respiratory problems, emergency medical care is warranted (ACAAI 2023).</span></p>

TEN is a syndrome in which large portions of skin become intensely erythematous with epidermal necrolysis. The skin peels off the body in the manner of a second-degree burn. This condition is usually seen in adults as a severe reaction to a drug, although it may be caused by infections, neoplastic disease, or chemical exposure. Its source may also be unknown (Dorland 2012, 1234). Codes are available to describe SJS (code L51.1), SJS with TEN (L51.3), and TEN (L51.2).</span></p>

The ulceration of tissue usually is at the location of a bony prominence that has been subjected to pressure against the skin by an external object such as lying-in bed, sitting in a wheelchair, or pressure from a cast or splint. The most frequent sites for a pressure ulcer are the sacrum, buttock, elbows, heels, outer ankles, inner knees, hips, shoulder blades, and occipital bone of the head. Other sites may be involved depending on the patient’s position in bed or in a sitting position. Patients at high risk for developing pressure ulcers are the elderly, patients of any age who are immobile and debilitated from their chronic diseases, or patients who are in bed for an extended period of time to recover from a severe injury. Patients may have more than one pressure ulcer, located at different sites on the body. Pressure ulcers may extend into deeper tissue including muscle and bone.

The pressure ulcers would be coded as L89.153 for the stage 3 sacral region, L89.612 for stage 2 of right heel, L89.622 for stage 2 of left heel, and L89.012 for stage 2 of right elbow.</span></p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-1">As of October 1, 2019, ICD-10-CM has been expanded to include codes for deep tissue pressure injury (DTPI). Previously, DTPI conditions were coded as an unstageable pressure injury. However, the usual approach to care for unstageable wounds is for the provider to debride the wound in order to determine the extent, and stage the wound once the wound could be seen or probed. DTPI in its early stages is not debrided; hence the code for unstageable wounds does not denote the problem. Deep tissue pressure injury is located in the ICD-10-CM Index as damage, deep tissue, pressured-induced  – see also L89 with final character of .6 for each site listed or under the main term of injury, pressure, injury – see Ulcer, pressure, by site.</span></p>

The code is constructed based on where the excisional procedure is performed on the skin, that is, what body part’s skin. A excisional debridement must be documented as excisional by the person who performs the debridement.  This procedure may be performed in an operating room, treatment room or at bedside by a provider with training and credentials required for this type of procedure. The entries in the </span><span class="CharOverride-1">Index for Excision of “subcutaneous tissue and fascia” procedures direct the coder to Table </span><span class="CharOverride-1">0JB to select a code for the Excision of subcutaneous tissue for the debridement according to the part body where the surgery is performed.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">For nonexcisional debridement, the entry in the Index is the main term “extraction, skin,” and it refers the coder to Table 0HD for skin and Table 0JD for subcutaneous tissue and fascia, respectively. Similar to the excisional procedures, the extraction procedures are constructed <span id="page431" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 431"></span>using the body part where the skin or subcutaneous tissue is removed with a non-excisional debridement procedure. Non-excisional debridement is considered an non-operative procedure such as brushing scrubbing, irrigation or washing of devitalized tissue, necrosis, foreign material or slough.  This is pulling or stripping out of tissue.  This procedure is likely performed in a treatment room or at bedside, but the location of the procedure on wounds has no influence on whether a procedure is excisional or non-excisional. </span></p>

The patient’s condition was diagnosed as irritant contact dermatitis due to cosmetics. During this visit, the physician also examined the patient’s cystic acne on her forehead and jawline. The patient was advised to continue using the medication previously prescribed. The patient was also advised to immediately discontinue use of any makeup on the face and was given a topical medication to resolve the inflammation, which was an adverse effect of the cosmetics.</p>
