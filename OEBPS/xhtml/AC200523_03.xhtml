			<p class="_-hd">Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">There are many uses for the data that are created by coding activity, including compiling statistical data. In order for these data to be useful, everyone gathering the data must collect the same data the same way. The <span class="CharOverride-2">Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS)</span> was promulgated by the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1974 as a minimum, common <span id="page92" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 92"></span>core of data on individual acute care short-term hospital discharges in Medicare and Medicaid programs. It sought to improve the uniformity and comparability of hospital discharge data.</p>
			<p class="Text">In 1985, the data set was revised to improve the original version in light of timely needs and developments. These data elements and their definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985, <span class="CharOverride-1">Federal Register</span> (50 FR 31038, Vol. 50, No. 147, 31038–31040). Since that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded to include all non-outpatient settings (acute care, short-term care, long-term care, and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehabilitation facilities; nursing homes; and so forth).</p>
			<p class="Text">Part of the current UHDDS includes the following specific items pertaining to patients and their episodes of care:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="BL-first"><span class="CharOverride-2">Personal identification/Unique Identifier:</span> The unique number assigned to each patient that distinguishes the patient and his or her health record from all others</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Patient name</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Date of birth</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Gender</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Race and ethnicity</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Residence:</span> The zip code or code for foreign residence</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Health care facility identification number:</span> The unique number assigned to each institution</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Admission data and type of admission</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Discharge date</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Attending physician identification:</span> The unique number assigned to each physician within the hospital (the attending physician and the operating physician [if applicable] are both to be identified)</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Surgeon identification</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Disposition of patient:</span> The destination of the patient upon leaving the hospital—discharged to home, left against medical advice, discharged to another short-term hospital, discharged to a long-term care institution, died, or other</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-bot"><span class="CharOverride-2">Expected payer:</span> The single major source expected by the patient to pay for this bill (for example, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Medicare, Medicaid, workers’ compensation)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">In keeping with UHDDS standards, medical data items for the following diagnoses and procedures also are reported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-2">Diagnoses:</span> All diagnoses affecting the current hospital stay must be reported as part of the UHDDS.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Principal diagnosis:</span> The principal diagnosis is designated and defined as the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Other diagnoses:</span> These are designated and defined as all conditions that coexist at the time of admission, that develop subsequently, or that affect the treatment received or the length of stay (LOS). Diagnoses are to be excluded that relate to an earlier <span id="page93" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 93"></span>episode that has no bearing on the current hospital stay. Within the Medicare Acute Care Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), other diagnoses may qualify as a major complication or comorbidity (MCC), or other complication or comorbidity (CC). The terms complication and comorbidity are not part of the UHDDS definition set but were developed as part of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system. The presence of the complication or comorbidity may influence the MS-DRG assignment and produce a higher-valued DRG with a higher payment for the hospital.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Complication:</span> This is defined as an <span class="CharOverride-1">additional</span> diagnosis that describes a condition arising after the beginning of hospital observation and treatment and then modifying the course of the patient’s illness or the medical care required.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Comorbidity:</span> This is defined as a <span class="CharOverride-1">pre-existing</span> condition that, because of its presence with a specific principal diagnosis, will likely cause an increase in the patient’s length of stay in the hospital.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Procedures and dates:</span> All significant procedures are to be reported. For significant procedures, both the identity (by unique number within the hospital) of the person &#173;performing the procedure and the date of the procedure must be reported.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Significant procedure:</span> A procedure is identified as significant when it<p class="BL ParaOverride-4"><span class="BL CharOverride-3"></span><span class="BL _idGenCharOverride-1">&#9;</span>Is surgical in nature</p><p class="BL ParaOverride-4"><span class="BL CharOverride-3"></span><span class="BL _idGenCharOverride-1">&#9;</span>Carries a procedural risk</p><p class="BL ParaOverride-4"><span class="BL CharOverride-3"></span><span class="BL _idGenCharOverride-1">&#9;</span>Carries an anesthetic risk</p><p class="BL ParaOverride-4"><span class="BL CharOverride-3"></span><span class="BL _idGenCharOverride-1">&#9;</span>Requires specialized training</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">Deciding whether a procedure performed is a significant procedure is often the determinant if the coder assigns a procedure code to identify the procedure. Nonsignificant procedures are usually not coded.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-2">Principal procedure:</span> This type of procedure is performed for definitive treatment rather than for diagnostic or exploratory purposes, or when it is necessary to take care of a complication.

			<span id="page94" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 94"></span>
			<p class="_-hd">Selection of Principal Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">As the UHDDS definition states, a principal diagnosis is the condition “established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care” (the UHDDS data elements and definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985, <span class="CharOverride-1">Federal Register</span> (50 FR 31038, Vol. 50, No. 147, 31038–31040)). Selecting the principal diagnosis depends on the circumstances of the admission, or why the patient was admitted. The admitting diagnosis has to be determined through diagnostic tests and studies. Therefore, the words “after study” serve as an integral part of this definition. During the course of hospitalization, the admitting diagnosis, which may be a symptom or ill-defined condition, could change substantially based on the results of further study.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted through the emergency department with an admitting diagnosis of seizure disorder. During hospitalization, diagnostic tests and studies revealed carcinoma of the brain, which explained the seizures.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub ParaOverride-5">&#9;The principal diagnosis was the carcinoma of the brain, which was the condition determined after study.</p>
			<p class="Text">At times, however, it may be difficult to distinguish between the <span class="CharOverride-1">principal</span> diagnosis and the <span class="CharOverride-1">most significant</span> diagnosis. The most significant diagnosis is defined as the condition <br />having the most impact on the patient’s health, LOS, resource consumption, and the like. However, the most significant diagnosis may or may not be the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted with a fractured hip due to an accident. The fracture was reduced and the patient discharged home.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub">&#9;In this case, the principal diagnosis was fracture of the hip.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted with a fractured hip due to an accident. While hospitalized, the patient suffered a myocardial infarction.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub ParaOverride-6">&#9;In this case, the principal diagnosis was still the fracture of the hip, with the myocardial infarction coded as an additional diagnosis. Although the myocardial infarction may be the most significant diagnosis in terms of the patient’s health and resource consumption, it was not the reason, after study, for the admission; therefore, it was not the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Text">Another important consideration in determining principal diagnosis is the fact that the coding conventions and instructions of the classification in ICD-10-CM take precedence over the Official Coding Guidelines. See Section I Conventions for the ICD-10-CM.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-7">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (CDC 2023). All coding students are strongly encouraged to read the guidelines and become familiar with the rules in order to put them into practice. The application of the guidelines in everyday practice helps to ensure data accuracy in both coding and reporting for all healthcare encounters. Reporting is the process <span id="page95" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 95"></span>of communicating the patient’s diagnoses and procedures in codes to third-party payers for reimbursement purposes and to other internal or facility databases and other external required databases for financial, quality measurement, public data, and other purposes.</p>
			<p class="Text">The <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> is referenced throughout this book. The complete document can be found in appendix F.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Selecting Principal Diagnosis for Inpatient Care</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The following information on selecting the principal diagnosis and additional diagnoses should be reviewed carefully to ensure appropriate coding and reporting of hospital claims.</p>
			<p class="Text">The circumstances of inpatient admission always govern selection of the principal diagnosis in keeping with the UHDDS definition of the term as “that condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care” (50 FR 31038, Vol. 50, No. 147, 31038–31040) and included in the Section II. Selection of the&#160;Principal Diagnosis, <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> FY 2024. The UHDDS definitions also include all non-outpatient settings including hospice services.</p>
			<p class="Text">In determining the principal diagnosis, the coding directives in ICD-10-CM, the Tabular List, and Alphabetic Index take precedence over all other guidelines.</p>
			<p class="Text">The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized. Without such documentation, the application of all coding guidelines is a difficult, if not impossible, task.</p>
			<p class="Text">Section II of the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> addresses the selection of the principal diagnosis:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-4">Guideline II.A. Codes for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined con</span><span class="CharOverride-4">di</span><span class="CharOverride-4">tions:</span> Codes for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions from chapter 18 are not to be used as the principal diagnosis when a related definitive diagnosis has been established.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted to the hospital with chest pain to rule out &#173;myocardial infarction. After study, myocardial infarction was ruled out; the cause of the chest pain was undetermined.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub">&#9;Code R07.9, Chest pain, unspecified, was assigned. Although the code for chest pain (R07.9) is located in Chapter 18, Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not <br />Elsewhere Classified, a &#173;definitive diagnosis could not be made, <br />so chest pain was coded as the &#173;principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted to the hospital with dysphagia secondary to malignant neoplasm of the esophagus. A PEG tube was inserted.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub">&#9;Code C15.9, Malignant neoplasm of the esophagus, &#173;unspecified, was selected as the principal diagnosis, with code R13.10 as an &#173;additional diagnosis to describe the dysphagia. Because the &#173;dysphagia was related to the malignancy and code R13.10 is from Chapter 18, the principal diagnosis was the definitive diagnosis rather than the symptom.</p>

Two or more interrelated conditions, each potentially meeting the definition for principal diagnosis:</span> When there are two or more interrelated conditions (such as diseases in the same ICD-10-CM chapter, or manifestations characteristically associated with a certain disease) potentially meeting the definition of principal diagnosis, either condition may be sequenced first, unless the circumstances of the admission, the therapy provided, the Tabular List, or the Alphabetic Index indicates otherwise.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted for initial treatment for a closed fracture of the right femur lower end and fracture of the right tibia upper end.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub">&#9;The following diagnosis codes were assigned: S72.401A, Fracture of femur, right, lower end, closed; S82.101A, Fracture of tibia, right, upper end, closed. Both fractures potentially met the definition of principal diagnosis; therefore, either code could be sequenced first.</p>

			<p class="XMS_Exm_first ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-2">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;Patient was admitted for elective surgery. A lesion on the left breast was excised and revealed fibroadenosis of breast. In addition, a right recurrent inguinal hernia was repaired.</p>
			<p class="XMS_Exm_first_Sub">&#9;The following diagnosis codes were assigned: N60.22, Fibroadenosis of left breast and K40.91, Unilateral inguinal hernia, without mention of obstruction or gangrene, recurrent. Both the fibroadenosis of left breast and the right recurrent inguinal hernia met the criteria for &#173;principal diagnosis. Therefore, either condition could be selected as the principal diagnosis.</p>

Two or more comparative or contrasting &#173;conditions:</span> In those rare instances when two or more &#173;contrasting or &#173;comparative diagnoses are documented as “either/or” (or &#173;similar terminology), they are coded as if confirmed and sequenced according to the circumstances of the admission. If no further determination can be made as to which diagnosis is principal, either diagnosis may be sequenced first.</p>
			<span id="page97" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 97"></span>

The bases for these guidelines are the diagnostic workup, arrangements for further workup or observation, and initial therapeutic approach that correspond most closely with the established diagnosis.

			<p class="_-hd">Reporting of Additional Diagnoses</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Deciding what else to code can be a challenge for coders. Physicians write many facts about the patient in terms of diagnoses and conditions that are present in the patient. However, not everything a physician includes in a record is something to be coded. The <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> help the coder decide what else to code in addition to the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Text">In the definition of “other diagnoses,” conditions that require clinical evaluation are to be coded. Clinical evaluation usually means the physician has taken the condition into &#173;consideration when examining the patient. An evaluation can mean the physician is &#173;considering testing of the&#160;condition or closely observing the condition to decide if new treatment is &#173;necessary or if the <br />current treatment is sufficient. Frequently when a condition is being evaluated, there also will be treatment or diagnostic procedures performed for it.</p>
			<p class="Text">The sequencing of the additional diagnoses is not mandated by a particular coding &#173;guideline. Generally, the diagnoses that were more significant in terms of what received the most attention during the patient’s hospital stay are listed first in the list of all additional &#173;diagnoses. This is a style that many coders follow but again, not a specific coding guideline.</p>
			<p class="Text">Section III of the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> addresses the general rules for reporting other or additional diagnoses. For example, the guidelines in Section III A through Section III C identify when previous conditions and abnormal findings of diagnostic tests are coded and how to code uncertain diagnoses as described by the physician as possible, probable, or similar terminology.</p>
			<p class="Text">For reporting purposes, the definition for “other diagnoses” is interpreted as additional conditions that affect patient care in terms of requiring one of the five factors about the patient care:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top ParaOverride-16">clinical evaluation;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">therapeutic treatment;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">diagnostic procedures;</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush">extended length of hospital stay; or</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-bot ParaOverride-17">increased nursing care or monitoring.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">The UHDDS item #11-B defines other diagnoses as “all conditions that coexist at the time of admission, that develop subsequently, or that affect the treatment received and/or the length of stay. Diagnoses that relate to an earlier episode that have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be excluded.” UHDDS definitions apply to inpatients in acute care, short- and long-term care, and psychiatric hospital settings. The UHDDS definitions are used by acute care short-term hospitals to report inpatient data in a standardized manner. These data elements and their definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985 <span class="CharOverride-1">Federal Register</span> (Vol. 50, No. 147, 31038–31040).</p>
			<p class="Text">Since that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded to include all non-outpatient settings (acute care, short- and long-term care, and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab facilities; nursing homes, and such). The UHDDS definitions also apply to hospice services (all levels of care).</p>
			<p class="Text">The following guidelines are to be applied in designating “other diagnoses” when neither the Alphabetic Index nor the Tabular List in ICD-10-CM provide directions. The listing of the diagnoses in the patient record is the responsibility of the attending provider.</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Section IV: Diagnostic Coding and Reporting Guidelines for Outpatient Services</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The coding of healthcare services in an outpatient setting is different from the coding of patients’ diagnoses provided in an inpatient setting. Outpatient encounters are often short &#173;visits, and there is not a lot of time to study the patient’s condition in depth. For the outpatient visit, the goal of coding is to code what is known for certain about the patient’s diagnosis, problem, or condition at that point in time and what was the focus of the healthcare attention at that time. The coding guidelines listed below direct the coder on how to code patient visits in a hospital outpatient setting, physician’s office, or other ambulatory care center.</p>
			<p class="Text">Section IV of the <span class="CharOverride-1">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span> address the general rules for diagnostic coding and reporting guidelines for outpatient services:</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt">These coding guidelines for outpatient diagnoses have been approved for use by hospitals/providers in coding and reporting hospital-based outpatient services and provider-based office visits. Guidelines in Section I, Conventions, general coding &#173;guidelines and chapter-specific guidelines, should also be applied for &#173;outpatient services and office visits.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Information about the use of certain abbreviations, punctuation, symbols, and other conventions used in the ICD-10-CM Tabular <span id="page103" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 103"></span>List (code numbers and titles) can be found in Section IA of these guidelines, under “Conventions Used in the Tabular List.” Section I.B. contains general guidelines that apply to the entire classification. Section I.C. contains chapter-specific guidelines that correspond to the chapters as they are arranged in the classification. Information about the correct sequence to use in finding a code is also described in Section I.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The terms encounter and visit are often used interchangeably in describing outpatient service contacts and, therefore, appear together in these guidelines without distinguishing one from the other.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Though the conventions and general guidelines apply to all &#173;settings, coding guidelines for outpatient and provider reporting of diagnoses will vary in a number of instances from those for inpatient diagnoses, recognizing that:</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">The Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of principal diagnosis does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services and provider-based office visits.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Coding guidelines for inconclusive diagnoses (probable, &#173;suspected, rule out, etc.) were developed for inpatient reporting and do not apply to outpatients.</p>

			<p class="CG_list-para-1">In the outpatient setting, the term first-listed diagnosis is used in lieu of principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-1">In determining the first-listed diagnosis the coding conventions of ICD-10-CM, as well as the general and disease specific guidelines take precedence over the outpatient guidelines.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-1">Diagnoses often are not established at the time of the initial encounter/visit. It may take two or more visits before the diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
			<p class="CG_list-para-1">The most critical rule involves beginning the search for the correct code assignment through the Alphabetic Index. Never begin searching initially in the Tabular List as this will lead to coding errors.</p>

			<p class="exer-long_mid ParaOverride-27"><span class="color CharOverride-7">7.</span>&#9;Patient was admitted to the hospital after having a seizure at work. The admitting diagnosis was to rule out epilepsy. After testing was performed, the cause of the seizure was not determined, as the physician stated the patient did not have epilepsy.</p>
			<p class="exer-long_mid"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">8.</span>&#9;Patient was admitted to the hospital with acute pyelonephritis and acute cystitis. Both infections were evaluated and treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy. The patient was discharged home to continue taking oral medications.</p>
			<p class="exer-long_mid"><span class="color CharOverride-7">9.</span>&#9;Patient was admitted to the hospital with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive &#173;pulmonary disease and acute low back pain. Both conditions were evaluated, and the patient received medical treatment. The patient was discharged home to continue to receive physical therapy for the back pain and pulmonary rehabilitation therapy for his chronic lung disease.</p>

			<p class="exer-long-2-digit ParaOverride-27"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">10.</span>&#9;The patient was admitted to the hospital with a multitude of gastrointestinal symptoms. After diagnostic tests were performed, the physician was unable to determine exactly what was causing the patient’s symptoms. The physician’s final diagnosis was “acute pancreatitis versus acute cholangitis.”</p>
			<p class="exer-long-2-digit"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">11.</span>&#9;The patient was admitted to the hospital with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. After study, the physician concluded the patient’s abdominal pain could have been due to either of two conditions. Her final diagnosis was abdominal pain due to either a ruptured ovarian cyst or acute salpingitis.</p>
			<p class="exer-long-2-digit">&#9;<span class="CharOverride-18">12.</span>&#9;The patient was admitted to the hospital for a total right knee replacement for osteoarthritis of the knee. During the patient’s preoperative preparation, the patient began having chest pain. <br />The patient’s knee surgery was cancelled, and the patient had extensive testing to determine the <br />source of the chest pain, which was determined to be due to hypertensive heart disease.</p>
			<p class="exer-long-2-digit"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">13.</span>&#9;The patient was readmitted to the hospital for a postoperative wound infection. The patient had been discharged from the hospital five days ago, after having colon surgery for ruptured diverticulitis. During this hospital stay, the patient was treated for the wound infection and monitored for the remaining diverticulitis in his colon.</p>
			<p class="exer-long-2-digit"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">14.</span>&#9;The patient was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. After study, the physician could not identify the exact cause of these symptoms but felt the most likely cause was pneumonia. The physician’s final diagnosis was “possible viral pneumonia now resolving.”</p>
			<p class="exer-long-2-digit"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">15.</span>&#9;The patient comes to the Emergency Department complaining of an asthma attack. The patient is placed into the observation unit to monitor his response to the asthma &#173;treatment. During the observation time, the patient is determined to have status &#173;asthmaticus and is admitted for treatment of this condition. After a three-day hospital stay, the patient’s asthma is better controlled, and he is discharged.</p>
			<p class="exer-long-2-digit ParaOverride-29"><span class="color _idGenCharOverride-2">16.</span>&#9;The patient was registered as an outpatient for a left-sided cataract extraction, which was performed successfully. While the patient was preparing to leave the hospital after surgery, the patient felt faint, and it was determined the patient’s blood pressure was much lower than earlier in the day. The patient was admitted to the hospital to monitor the low blood pressure. The next day, the patient felt well again and was discharged. The&#160;physician described the patient’s condition as “orthostatic hypotension.”</p>
