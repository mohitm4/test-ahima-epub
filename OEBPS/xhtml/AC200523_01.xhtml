			<p class="_-hd">Characteristics of ICD-10-CM</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The ICD-10-CM system is used for all diagnosis coding and began on October 1, 2015. &#173;All providers use the code set in the United States health care setting. ICD-10-CM is divided into the Alphabetic Index, which is an alphabetic listing of terms and codes, and the Tabular List, which is a numerical list of the codes divided by chapters.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-5">Conventions for ICD-10-CM</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">To assign ICD-10-CM codes accurately, a thorough understanding of the ICD-10-CM conventions is necessary. These coding conventions are located within the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. They address the structure and format of the coding system, including how to use the Alphabetic Index and the Tabular List, as well as the rules and instructions that the coder must follow.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-5">Alphabetic Index</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">According to the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, the </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> is an alphabetic listing of terms and their corresponding codes (CDC 2023). The Alphabetic Index is divided into two parts—the Index to Diseases and Injury and the Index to External Causes of Injury. Within the Index of Diseases and Injury, there is a Neoplasm Table and a Table of Drugs and Chemicals.</span></p>

			<h4 class="_-hd"><i>Main Terms</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries in ICD-10-CM is formatted with main terms set in boldface and listed in alphabetical order. </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Main terms</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> are entries printed in boldface type and flush with the left margin of each column in the Alphabetic Index. Main terms represent the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-2">Diseases such as influenza or bronchitis</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Conditions such as fatigue, fracture, or injury</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="page11" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 11"></span>Nouns such as disease, disorder, or syndrome</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Adjectives such as double, kink, or large</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The Alphabetic Index is the first place the coder uses to locate the ICD-10-CM code for the patient’s disease or condition. Instead of a listing of sites where diseases may occur, &#173;ICD-10-CM provides anatomical terms with a cross-reference that directs the coder to reference the condition. For example, bronchial asthma is found under the disease term “asthma” rather than the anatomical term or site of “bronchial.” However, if the anatomical term is part of the disease title, the anatomical term may be the main term. For example, the diagnosis of “acute abdomen” is found in the Alphabetic Index under the main term of “abdomen.”</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Many conditions are found in more than one place in the Alphabetic Index. For example:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-2">Complications of medical and surgical care are indexed under the name of the condition as well as under the main term “Complications.” For example, kidney transplant failure is found under “complication, transplant, kidney” and “failure, transplant, kidney.”</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Obstetrical conditions are found under the name of the condition and under the main terms such as “Delivery,” “Pregnancy,” or “Puerperal.” For example, preterm delivery is found under “Delivery, preterm” and “Pregnancy, complicated by, preterm.”</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-bot"><span class="CharOverride-2">Conditions that include the term “disease” or “syndrome” in their titles or descriptions may be found under “Disease” or “Syndrome” as well as under the disease or syndrome’s name. For example, “chronic obstruction lung disease” may be found in the Alphabetic Index under “Disease, lung, obstructive” as well as under “Obstructive, lung, disease.”</span></li>

Subterms are indented one standard indentation to the right under the main term. Subterms describe essential differences in the site, cause, or the clinical type of the condition. More specific subterms are indented farther to the right as needed, indented one standard indentation after the preceding subterm, and listed in alphabetic order. The dash (-) at the end of an Index entry indicates that additional characters are required.</span></p>

			<h4 class="_-hd"><i>Carryover Lines</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-4">Carryover lines</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> are needed on occasion in the Alphabetic Index because the number of words that can fit on a single line of print is limited. They are two indents from the preceding line. Coders must be careful to avoid confusing the carryover line with the subterm entries. For example, the diagnosis of “Cesarean delivery occurring after 37 weeks of gestation but before 39 completed weeks of gestation due to spontaneous onset of labor” is found in the Alphabetic Index under the main term “delivery” with the subterm “cesarean” with a carryover line starting with the phrase “occurring after 37 completed weeks.” The following is an example of a carryover line as it appears in the Alphabetic Index:</span></p>
			<p class="BX_first ParaOverride-9">Delivery (childbirth) (labor)</p>

			<h4 class="_-hd"><i>Nonessential Modifiers</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">A term or a series of terms that appear in parentheses following a main term or subterm are known as </span><span class="CharOverride-4">nonessential modifiers</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. The presence or absence of these parenthetical terms in the diagnosis statement has no effect on the selection of the codes listed for that main term or subterm. The words in parentheses are not considered important descriptors of the diagnosis or condition in the ICD-10-CM classification system.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The nonessential modifiers apply to the main term and to subterms following the main term. However, there is an exception to this rule when a nonessential modifier term and a subterm are mutually exclusive. In this instance, the subterm takes precedence for the code assigned. For example, the subterms of “acute” and “chronic” are mutually exclusive descriptors. <br />In the Alphabetic Index, under the main term “enteritis,” there is a nonessential modifier of “acute.” There is also a subterm of “chronic” under enteritis in the Alphabetic Index. In this example, the nonessential modifier of acute does not apply to the subterm chronic for enteritis.</span></p>

			<p class="TS_T"><span class="CharOverride-2">For example, if the patient was discharged from the hospital after treatment of acute pneumonia, the diagnosis code assigned is J18.9.

			<p class="TS_T"><span class="CharOverride-2">For example, if the patient was seen in the emergency department and a diagnosis of “pneumonia” was made, the appropriate code assignment would be J18.9. No essential modifier is included in the diagnostic statement.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The Alphabetic Index in ICD-10-CM includes both “see” and “see also” instructions following a main term to indicate that another term should be referenced. The “see” direction is used to instruct the coder to reference another term in the Alphabetic Index that provides more complete information about the condition to be coded. The “see” note also appears with an anatomical site main term to direct the coder to locate the disease present at that anatomic site in the Alphabetic Index.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The </span><span class="CharOverride-4">“see” note</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> is a cross-reference term in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases and Injuries that provides direction to the coder to look elsewhere in the Index before assigning a code.

			<h4 class="_-hd ParaOverride-13"><i>Categories, Subcategories, and Codes</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The characters for categories, subcategories, and codes may contain either letters or numbers. A </span><span class="CharOverride-4">category</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> is composed of three characters that represent a single disease or a group of similar or closely related conditions. A three-character category that has no further subdivision is equivalent to a code.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Most three-character categories are further subdivided into four- or five-character subcategories. Codes can be three, four, five, six, or seven characters. Each level of subdivision after a category is a </span><span class="CharOverride-4">subcategory</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. Five- and six-character codes provide greater specificity or additional information about the condition being coded. The subcategory codes add more specificity to the description of the disease in terms of the etiology (cause of the disease), site (anatomic location), severity, or the manifestation of the disease. A manifestation may be a complication of the disease or characteristics, signs, symptoms, or secondary processes that occur with the disease or illness.</span></p>
			<span id="page20" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 20"></span>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The final level of subdivision of a category is a code. Certain categories have an additional seventh character. The seventh character must always be the final character of the code. When the code contains fewer than seven characters, yet a 7th character is required by the Tabular, the placeholder X must be used to fill the empty character(s) spaces.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The fourth character 8, when placed after a decimal point (.8), is used to indicate some “other” specified category. The fourth character 9, when placed after a decimal point (.9), is usually reserved for an unspecified condition.

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Two abbreviations are used in ICD-10-CM: Not Elsewhere Classifiable and Not Otherwise Specified.</span></p>
			<h4 class="_-hd"><i><i>NEC: Not Elsewhere Classifiable</i></i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">An abbreviation of </span><span class="CharOverride-4">not elsewhere classifiable (NEC)</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> is used in ICD-10-CM. This abbreviation appears in the Alphabetic Index. When NEC appears in the Alphabetic Index, it will direct the coder to the Tabular List showing an “other specified” codes description. The NEC entry appears when a specific code is not available. The NEC code usually directs the coder to an “other specified” code in the Tabular List that includes the number 8 after the decimal point.</span></p>

			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-26">Punctuation</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The punctuation used in ICD-10-CM is brackets, parentheses, and colons.</span></p>
			<h4 class="_-hd"><i>Brackets [ ]</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-4">Square brackets [ ]</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> are a punctuation mark used in the Tabular List to enclose synonyms, abbreviations, alternative wording, or explanatory phrases.

Manifestation codes represent the secondary condition that is present in addition to the underlying or primary disease that caused the secondary condition. Two codes are required when the patient has both the underlying disease and the secondary condition. The use of the slanted bracket in the Alphabetic Index provides sequencing direction. The code that appears in the slanted bracket is listed in the second position or follows the disease code listed directly after the diagnosis term in the Index. The diagnosis in the slanted brackets is not entered into a computer or data entry system in the italicized font. The italicized font is used to emphasize the presence of the second code that is required.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">ICD-10-CM provides codes to be used when the documentation in the health record is more specific than any code available to be used. On the other hand, ICD-10-CM has codes that can be used when the documentation in the health record is insufficient to assign a specific code that is available in ICD-10-CM. Coders must appreciate the differences in these codes that include the terminology of other, other specified, and unspecified in the code title and know when these codes are appropriate to be used.</span></p>
			<h4 class="_-hd"><i>Other or Other Specified Codes</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The terms </span><span class="CharOverride-4">“other”</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> or </span><span class="CharOverride-4">“other specified” codes</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> are used when the information in the health record is more descriptive than the available codes in ICD-10-CM.

			<h4 class="_-hd ParaOverride-30"><i>Beginning of Chapter Note</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">At the beginning of many chapters of ICD-10-CM, the chapter starts with a “note.” The note introduces the content of the chapter and the intended use of the categories and codes within the chapter. Instructions on how to apply the codes from a particular chapter are also explained in the beginning of chapter note.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">At the start of Chapter 2: Neoplasms (C00–D49), there are four beginning of chapter notes. The “Functional Activity” note explains that “all neoplasms are classified in this chapter, whether they are functionally active or not, and that an additional code from Chapter 4 may be used to identify functional activity associated with any neoplasm” (CDC 2023). Additional notes explain the concepts of morphology or histology, primary malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries, and malignant neoplasm of ectopic tissue.</span></p>

			<h4 class="_-hd"><i>Inclusion Terms</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-4">Inclusion terms</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> are lists of medical diagnoses under some codes in the Tabular List. These are conditions for which that code is to be used. The terms may be synonyms of the code title or the terms are a list of various conditions assigned to “other specified” codes.

			<h4 class="_-hd ParaOverride-34"><i>Excludes Notes</i></h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">ICD-10-CM has two types of excludes notes. Each type of note has a different definition for use. However, they are similar in intent. The </span><span class="CharOverride-4">excludes note</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> indicates that codes excluded from each other are independent of each other. In ICD-10-CM, there are two types of excludes notes designated as either Excludes1 or Excludes2 in their title. Either or both may appear under a category, subcategory, or code.</span></p>
			<h4 class="D ParaOverride-34">The Excludes1 Note</h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Excludes1 note</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> indicates that the conditions listed after it cannot ever be used at the same time as the code above the Excludes1 note. The conditions listed in the code and in the&#160;Excludes1 note are mutually exclusive. A patient cannot have both conditions at the same time. The coder must determine, based on the documentation in the health record, which &#173;condition the patient actually has in order to assign the correct code.</span></p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;E06 Thyroiditis</span></p>
			<p class="XM_IL-1 ParaOverride-12"><span class="CharOverride-2">Excludes1: postpartum thyroiditis (O90.5)</span></p>
			<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2">
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-2">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">In this example, a patient who is in the postpartum period and has thyroiditis would have the diagnosis code O90.5 assigned. Other patients who have thyroiditis and are not in the &#173;postpartum period would have the disease coded as E06.-. This is an either/or situation. Both codes could not be used on the same patient during the same episode of care.</span></p>
			<span id="page28" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 28"></span>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">An exception to the Excludes1 definition is the circumstance when the two conditions are unrelated to each other. If it is not clear whether the two conditions involving an Excludes1 note are related or not, query the provider. For example, code F45.8, Other somatoform disorders, has an Excludes1 note for “sleep related teeth grinding (G47.63),” because “teeth grinding” is an inclusion term under F45.8. Only one of these two codes should be assigned for teeth grinding. However psychogenic dysmenorrhea is also an inclusion term under F45.8, and a patient could have both this condition and sleep related teeth grinding. In this case, the two conditions are clearly unrelated to each other, and so it would be appropriate to report F45.8 and G47.63 together.</span></p>
			<h4 class="D ParaOverride-35">The Excludes2 Note</h4>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The </span><span class="CharOverride-4">Excludes2 note</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> means that two codes are applied when both conditions are present. The conditions that appear as an Excludes2 note are not part of the code that is listed above it. </span><span class="CharOverride-2">A&#160;patient may have both conditions at the same time. One code does not include both condi</span><span class="CharOverride-2">tions. When both conditions are present, two codes are applied. A coder can think of it as 2 codes are required when there is documentation for a condition present in the Excludes 2 note.</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">In this example, a patient can have sleep disorders and nightmares at the same time. The Excludes2 note means that code G47 for sleep disorders does not include the condition of nightmares. When the patient has both a sleep disorder and nightmares, two codes must be used: a code from the category G47 and the code F51.4.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Etiology and Manifestation Convention</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Some diseases produce another disease or a condition the patient would not have without the underlying disease. In ICD-10-CM, there is a coding convention that requires two codes for situations when one disease produces another condition. The first disease is considered the </span><span class="CharOverride-4">etiology,</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> and the second condition that it produces is called the </span><span class="CharOverride-4">manifestation</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. The &#173;etiology or the first disease must be coded first. The manifestation(s) are listed as additional codes.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-5">Code First and Use Additional Code Notes</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The coding convention used in ICD-10-CM that directs the coder as to which condition is coded first is known as a </span><span class="CharOverride-4">“code first” note</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. The “code first” note appears in the Tabular List under the manifestation code to identify the condition usually considered the etiologic &#173;condition. The title of the manifestation code usually includes the phrase “in diseases classified elsewhere” in the title. It is important to remember that the “in diseases classified elsewhere” or “in other specified diseases classified elsewhere” codes are never first-listed or principal diagnosis codes, nor can these codes be listed as a single code. These manifestation codes also appear in </span><span class="CharOverride-3">italicized fonts</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. These instructions make sure the proper sequencing of codes&#160;is followed, that is, the etiology condition is coded first, followed by the manifestation code. “Code first” notes also appear under codes that are not specifically manifestation codes but may be due to an underlying cause. When there is a “code first” note and underlying cause, the underlying cause should be sequenced, if known.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">There are also diseases that require two codes to completely describe the condition because all the facts of the disease are not expressed in one code. When such a condition exists, the &#173;coding convention in ICD-10-CM will remind the coder to </span><span class="CharOverride-4">“use additional code”</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> to fully describe the condition. This also indicates the sequencing required with the code identified as the “use additional code” listed as an additional code, if known.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The etiology and manifestation conventions appear in both the Alphabetic Index and the Tabular List. In the Alphabetic Index, both conditions may be listed on one line with the etiology code listed first and the manifestation code appearing in slanted brackets after it. The code in the brackets is never listed first or used as a single code. The manifestation code must be listed second. In the Tabular List, there are notes the coder must read at the category or at the code level, that is, “code first” a certain condition or “use additional code” as an additional code to the code it appears with.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">An example of the etiology or manifestation convention is dementia in Alzheimer’s &#173;disease. The main term is disease, subterm is Alzheimer’s, with an indent term for early onset.</span></p>
			<span id="page30" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 30"></span>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">In the above example, Alzheimer’s disease with early onset is coded to G30.0. Under category G30, there is a directive to “use additional code to identify” dementia without behavioral disturbance (F02.80). If the patient had early-onset Alzheimer’s disease with dementia without behavioral disturbance, two codes would be required: G30.0 with F02.80. Under category F02, Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere, there is a “code first the underlying physiological condition, such as” note directing the coder to first assign a code for the type of Alzheimer’s disease present with a code from category G30.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-18">Code First</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-4">“Code first”</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> notes appear under certain codes that are not specifically manifestation codes. But certain conditions may be due to an underlying cause. When there is a code first note and an underlying condition present, the underlying condition should be sequenced first, if known. In the following example, a patient with malignant ascites suffers from the ascites because the patient also has a malignant condition that should be coded first as it is the underlying cause of the ascites.</span></p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;R18.0, Malignant ascites</span></p>

			<p class="XM_IL-1-2em"><span class="CharOverride-2">malignant neoplasm of ovary (C56.-)</span></p>
			<p class="XM_IL-1-2em"><span class="CharOverride-2">secondary malignant neoplasm of retroperitoneum and &#173;peritoneum (C78.6)</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-38">Code, If Applicable, a Causal Condition First</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">A “</span><span class="CharOverride-4">Code, if applicable, a causal condition first</span><span class="CharOverride-2">” note indicates that this code may be assigned as a first-listed or principal diagnosis when the causal condition is unknown or not applicable. If a causal condition is known, then the code for that condition should be sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis. In the following example, if a patient has urinary retention and the cause of the urinary retention, such as an enlarged prostate, is known, the code for the enlarged prostate is coded first followed by a second code for the urinary retention.</span></p>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;R33.8, Other retention of urine</span></p>

			<p class="XM_IL-1-2em"><span class="CharOverride-2">Enlarged prostate (N40.1)</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-38">Code Also</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">A “Code also” note indicates that two codes may be required to fully describe a condition. This note does not provide sequencing direction, that is, either code may be listed first depending on the circumstances of the medical visit or admission. In the following example, a patient may be seen for the purpose of receiving renal dialysis. The fact that the patient has end-stage renal disease that requires the patient to have renal dialysis is an important fact that is reported with an additional code.</span></p>
			<span id="page31" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 31"></span>
			<p class="XM_first"><span class="CharOverride-4">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;Z49, Encounter for care involving renal dialysis</span></p>
			<p class="XM_IL-1"><span class="CharOverride-2">Code also associated end stage renal disease (N18.6)</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-30">Indiscriminate Multiple Coding</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-4">Indiscriminate multiple coding</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> rules identify when multiple codes should or should not </span><span class="CharOverride-2">occur. For example, multiple codes should not be used to code irrelevant medical information, such as certain signs and symptoms that are integral to a condition. The signs and symptoms that are characteristic of an illness are not coded when the cause of the signs and symptoms are known. For example, abdominal pain is integral to acute pancreatitis and thus is not coded.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Another rule is that indiscriminate coding of conditions listed in diagnostic test reports should be avoided. When a laboratory test, x-ray, electrocardiogram, or other diagnostic test includes a finding, that condition is not coded unless the diagnosis is confirmed by the physician.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Coders must follow the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) criteria when reporting additional diagnosis and how to avoid indiscriminate multiple coding. That is, other diagnoses are those defined as all conditions that coexist at the time of admission, that develop subsequently, or that affect the treatment received or the length of stay (LOS). Diagnoses are to be excluded that relate to an earlier episode that has no bearing on the current hospital stay. Other diagnostic reports mention conditions like atelectasis, hiatal hernia, or nonspecific cardiac arrhythmias with no other information in the record as to treatment of evaluation of these conditions. Assigning a code for such conditions would be inappropriate without first consulting with the physician for the relevance of these conditions to the present healthcare visit.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Finally, coding both a specified and an unspecified type of condition is usually not done to describe the same general condition in the same healthcare visit. For example, if the patient’s diagnosis is recurrent maxillary sinusitis, code J01.01 would be assigned. It would not be &#173;necessary to also code sinusitis with code J32.9 as the type (recurrent) and the site (maxillary) are best described with the code J01.01.</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Cross-references such as “See” and “See also” are used as directions for the coder to look elsewhere in the Alphabetic Index before assigning a code. Other terms are used to explain the relationships between the diagnoses and conditions included in both the Alphabetic Index <br />and the Tabular List. To assign diagnosis codes accurately, a thorough understanding of the ICD-10-CM cross-references and other terms is essential.</span></p>

In the following example, code Z51.1 is used if the patient’s encounter is for the purpose of receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy or for the purpose of receiving antineoplastic immunotherapy. If the patient is receiving both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the code is also appropriate to use.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">General Coding Guidelines</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">There are basic concepts and rules that a coder must understand in order to assign ICD-10-CM codes accurately and completely. These general coding guidelines describe how to locate a code in ICD-10-CM and how to apply all the necessary codes to fully describe a patient’s condition and reason for health services.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd">Locating a Code in ICD-10-CM</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The coder must use both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List when locating and assigning a code. The first step in coding is to locate the main term and applicable subterms in the Alphabetic Index. Then, the code found in the Alphabetic Index is verified in the Tabular List. The coder must read and be guided by the instructional notations that appear in both the Alphabetic Index and the Tabular List.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The Alphabetic Index does not always provide the complete code or applicable notes. Every code listed in the Alphabetic Index must be reviewed in the Tabular List. Selection of the complete code, including laterality and any applicable seventh character, can only be done in the <span id="page35" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 35"></span>Tabular List. If additional characters are required, a dash (-) at the end of the Alphabetic Index entry is present. The coder then uses the Tabular List to identify what additional characters are necessary to complete the code to fully describe the patient’s condition. Even if it appears that a complete code is included in the Alphabetic Index, it is mandatory for the coder to review the code in the Tabular List for all the instructional notes that may require additional coding.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-45">Level of Detail in Coding</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Diagnosis codes are to be used and reported with the highest number of characters available. Codes with three characters are included in ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of codes. A category may be further subdivided by the use of fourth, fifth, or sixth characters to provide greater detail. A seventh character may be applicable for certain codes. A three-character code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided, that is, there are no applicable fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh characters to be used. A code is invalid if it is not coded to the full number of characters required for that code. Remember, the use of the placeholder X can be utilized in situations where a seventh character is required.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-30">Code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00–Z99.8, U00–U85</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">The appropriate code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00–Z99.8 and U00–U85 must be used to identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems, complaints or other reason(s) for the encounter/visit.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-30">Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Codes that describe symptoms and physical signs are perfectly acceptable for reporting when the sign or symptom is what the physician knows for certain about the patient at the conclusion of the encounter. There are occasions when no definitive diagnosis can be made, even after investigation or study of the patient’s presenting signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms may be transient and disappear before the physician can identify their cause. A patient may come to a physician for treatment of a sign or symptom but fail to return for further investigation and it is not determined what caused the problem. Patients with certain signs and symptoms may be referred to another physician or treatment center for investigation before the physician can identify the cause of the symptom or sign. In all of these situations and the other scenarios described at the start of Chapter 18: Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not Elsewhere Classified (R00–R99), the assignment of a sign or symptom code is appropriate. Most but not all signs and symptoms appear in Chapter 18. Signs and symptoms applicable to certain body systems appear in the body system chapter of ICD-10-CM, for example, ear pain is assigned a code from ICD-10-CM Chapter 8: Diseases of the Ear and Mastoid Process.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-45">Conditions That Are an Integral Part of a Disease Process</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Signs and symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process should not be assigned as additional codes, unless other instructions exist. Once the reason for the signs and symptoms are known and these complaints routinely occur with that particular disease process, the signs and symptoms are not coded. For example, abdominal pain is a common symptom of acute appendicitis and is not coded when the reason for abdominal pain is attributed to the appendicitis. The coder’s knowledge of disease processes is essential to coding, especially to avoid coding the unnecessary signs and symptoms codes.</span></p>
			<span id="page36" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 36"></span>
			<h3 class="_-hd">Conditions That Are Not an Integral Part of a Disease Process</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Additional signs and symptoms that may not be associated routinely with a disease process should be coded when present. Again, the coder’s knowledge of disease pathology is essential to coding. The coder needs to know when the physician describes accompanying signs and symptoms with a disease whether to code these conditions or not. For example, if a patient&#160;with a skull fracture is in a coma, the coma is assigned an additional code. Not every patient with a skull fracture will be in a coma. This additional detail about the patient’s condition that is not present routinely with the injury or disease is valuable information concerning the patient’s severity of their illness.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-3">Multiple Coding for a Single Condition</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Multiple codes may be required to code a disease that includes multiple disease processes or factors. As noted in the prior section, ICD-10-CM uses such conventions as “use additional code” in the Tabular List to identify a condition that is not part of the code it appears with. Another example when a “use additional code” note appears is with an infectious disease code that does not identify the specific bacterial or viral organism that caused it, but that organism can be identified with another code.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Other requirements for multiple coding of a single condition or a condition that includes multiple parts can be identified in ICD-10-CM with such notes as “code first,” code, if applicable, a causal condition first, and “code also.”</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-46">Acute and Chronic Conditions</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">If a patient has both the acute form and the chronic form of one disease, the coder must identify in the Alphabetic Index if there are separate entries at the same indentation level. If there are <br />two separate lines in the Alphabetic Index for acute and chronic forms, then both codes <br />are assigned. The acute or subacute code is sequenced first, followed by the chronic code for the disease. For example, the physician may describe the patient’s condition as acute and chronic pancreatitis. The Alphabetic Index includes but is not limited to the following entries:</span></p>

			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-48">Combination Codes</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">A combination code is a single code used to classify two diagnoses. A combination code may also represent a diagnosis with an associated secondary process or manifestation. Finally, a combination code can be a diagnosis with an associated complication.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Combination codes are identified by referring to subterm entries in the Alphabetic Index that identify conditions that are associated with or due to each other. Combination codes are also identified by reading all the includes and excludes notes in the Tabular List. Combination codes are only assigned when the one code fully identifies the condition.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Multiple coding should not occur when the classification provides a combination code that clearly identifies all of the elements documented in the diagnosis. An additional code should be used as a secondary code only when the combination code lacks necessary specificity in describing the manifestation or complication. There may be a third condition that exists with two other conditions that requires an additional code. For example, a patient may have acute bronchitis with bronchiectasis and tobacco use. Two codes are required: J47.0, a combination code for bronchiectasis with acute bronchitis, and Z72.0, the code for tobacco use.</span></p>

			<h3 class="_-hd">Sequela or Late Effects</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">A condition that is produced by another illness or an injury and remains after the acute phase of the illness or injury is referred to as a </span><span class="CharOverride-4">sequela</span><span class="CharOverride-2">. There is no time period as to when a sequela must appear or be present. The condition can be identified at the same time as the original disease, such as dysphagia that occurs with a cerebral infarction. Other conditions may occur a period of time after the acute phase of the illness is over, for example, the scar that remains after a burn heals.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">Two codes are required for coding sequela conditions. The first reported code is the &#173;condition that exists at present or the sequela. The second code is the original condition &#173;identified as the cause of the present condition. However, the code for the acute phase of an illness that led to the sequela is never used with a code for the late effect.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">There are exceptions to the above guideline:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-top"><span class="CharOverride-2">The code for the sequela is followed by a manifestation code identified in the Tabular List and title.</span></li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush-bot"><span class="CharOverride-2">The sequela code has been expanded at the fourth, fifth, or sixth character levels to include the manifestations.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The main term “sequela” must be referenced in the Alphabetic Index to identify if a combination code for the sequela and the underlying cause exists. In the Tabular List, an instructional note may appear under these category codes to “code first condition resulting from (sequela of)” that particular category. In the Alphabetic Index, following the main term “sequela,” is the direction term “see also condition” to remind the coder that other entries in the Alphabetic Index are also applicable to coding of these conditions.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The following is a step-by-step example of how to accurately code a sequela and the underlying condition:</span></p>
			<span id="page39" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 39"></span>
			<p class="IL ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-18">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-17"> A physician documents the following condition: scar of the skin on the face due to previous third-degree burn of the face. The coder must recognize the condition present today is the scar and the cause of the scar was the previous third-degree burn on the face.</span></p>
			<p class="T ParaOverride-50"><span class="CharOverride-17">First the coder accesses the term “scar” in the Alphabetic Index as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub_First ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-17">Alphabetic Index:</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub2 ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-17">Scar, scarring (see also Cicatrix) L90.5</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub2 ParaOverride-51"><span class="CharOverride-17">Cicatrix, skin L90.5</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-17">Then, the coder must confirm the code in the Tabular List as L90.5. There are no further instructions in the Tabular List. The code does not include any anatomic locations so all scars of the skin are coded here. However, the coder must know to identify the cause of the scar having been stated as due to a previous burn on the face.</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-52"><span class="CharOverride-17">The coder must translate that fact to the word “sequela” to identify the burn and use the Alphabetic Index again as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub ParaOverride-53"><span class="CharOverride-17">Alphabetic Index:</span></p>
			<p class="IL-sub2 ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-17">Sequela, burn and corrosion—code to injury with seventh character S</span></p>

			<p class="IL-sub2 ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-17">Burn, head, third degree, T20.30</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-52"><span class="CharOverride-17">Again, the coder must access the Tabular List to review the entry of code T20.30 to &#173;determine if more characters are required to complete the coding assignment.</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-17">T20.30 requires a seventh character of S for sequela; therefore, a placeholder character of X is needed in the sixth position, that is, T20.30XS.</span></p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-52"><span class="CharOverride-17">After following these steps, the coder concludes that the coding of scar of the skin of the face due to previous third-degree burn of the face is coded as L90.5 and T20.30XS.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd">Impending or Threatened Condition</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Physicians may describe a patient’s condition as impending or threatened, such as impending delirium tremens or threatened abortion. The coder needs to determine if the condition actually did or did not occur. The ICD-10-CM classification and guidelines give directions to the coder on how to interpret this terminology used by physicians. According to the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, Guideline I.B.11, impending or threatened conditions are coded as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">If a condition described at the time of discharge as “impending” or “threatened,” it should be coded as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="NL_first"><span class="Bold1 _idGenCharOverride-2">1.</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;If the condition did occur, code as a confirmed diagnosis.</span></p>
			<p class="NL_Mid"><span class="Num-Bold _idGenCharOverride-2">2.</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;If the condition did not occur, reference the Alphabetic Index to determine if the condition has a subentry term for “impending” or “threatened” and also reference main term entries for “Impending” and for “Threatened.”</span></p>

			<p class="Block_Quote-LA-first"><span class="Num-Bold CharOverride-19">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-2">&#9;If the subterms are not listed, code the existing underlying condition(s) and not the condition described as impending or threatened (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<span id="page40" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 40"></span>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-38">Reporting Same Diagnosis Code More Than Once</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">According to the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, Guideline I.B.12, “each unique ICD-10-CM diagnosis code may be reported only once for an encounter. This applies to bilateral conditions when there are no distinct codes identifying laterality or two different conditions classified to the same ICD-10-CM diagnosis code” (CDC 2023). For example, if a patient had cellulitis on both sides on the face, the diagnosis code of L03.211, Cellulitis of face, would be reported once as there are no distinct codes for cellulitis of the right face or left face.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-34">Laterality</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Some ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes include laterality or whether the condition exists on the right or left side of the body and for bilateral sites. The final character of the code indicates laterality. An unspecified side code is available for use if the side of the body is not identified in the health </span><span class="CharOverride-2">record. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, the coder must assign sepa</span><span class="CharOverride-2">rate codes for both the left and right side. For example, if a patient had a right ovarian carcinoma, then code C56.1, Malignant neoplasm of right ovary would be used. Separate codes exist of the left ovary (C56.2) and unspecified ovary (C56.9). Another example of laterality indicated by the codes occurs when ICD-10-CM includes the option of unilateral, bilateral, or unspecified. For example, <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-2">if the physician documents small kidney of unknown origin on the left side, code N27.0, <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-2">Small kidney, unilateral, would be assigned. Other options in category N27 include code N27.1, </span><span class="CharOverride-2">small kidney, bilateral, and N27.9, small kidney, unspecified. The </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> addresses the subject of laterality in the code in Guideline I.B.13.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-38">Documentation by Clinicians Other Than the Patient’s Provider</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">In the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, Guideline I.B.14 describes code assignment based on the documentation by patient’s provider with a few exceptions, such body mass index (BMI) and depth of non-pressure chronic ulcers:</span></p>
			<p class="SL_First ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-2">For the body mass index (BMI), depth of non-pressure chronic ulcers and pressure ulcer stage codes, coma scale, and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) codes, the code assignment may be made based on the medical record documentation from clinicians who are not the patient’s provider (such as a physician or other qualified healthcare practitioner legally accountable for &#173;establishing the patient’s diagnosis). This information is typically documented by other clinicians involved in the care of the patient, for example, a dietitian documents the BMI and nurses often document the pressure ulcer stages. However, the associated diagnosis (such as overweight, obesity or pressure ulcer) must be documented by the patient’s provider. If there is conflicting medical record documentation, either from the same clinician or different <br />clinicians, the patient’s attending provider should be queried for clarification.</span></p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-54"><span class="CharOverride-2">Guideline I.B.14 is guidance for social determinants of health, such as information found in categories Z55-Z65:</span></p>
			<p class="SL-text ParaOverride-55"><span class="CharOverride-2">For persons with potential health hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances, code assignment may be based on medical record documentation from clinicians involved in the care of the patient who are not the patient’s provider since this information </span><span class="CharOverride-2">represents social information, rather than medical diagnoses. Patient self-reported documenta</span><span class="CharOverride-2">tion may also be used to assign codes for social determinants of health, as long as the patient self-&#173;reported information is signed-off by and incorporated into the health record by either a clinician or provider (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<span id="page41" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 41"></span>
			<p class="SL-text ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-2">The BMI, coma scale, NIHSS, blood alcohol level codes, and codes for social &#173;determinants of health and underimmunization status should only be reported as secondary diagnoses. As with all other secondary diagnosis codes, the BMI codes should only be assigned when they meet the definition of a reportable additional diagnosis (CDC 2023). Guideline Section I.C.21.c.17. provides additional information regarding coding social determinants of health. </span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd">Syndromes</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">Guideline I.B.15 in the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> describes the coding of named syndromes.</span></p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-49"><span class="CharOverride-2">The coder should follow the Alphabetic Index guidance when coding named syndromes. In the absence of Alphabetic Index guidance, the coder should assign codes for the documented manifestations of the syndrome. Additional codes for manifestations that are not an integral part of the disease process may also be assigned when the condition does not have a unique code (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-56"><span class="CharOverride-2">For example, ICD-10-CM diagnosis code I82.0, Budd-Chiari syndrome, is a known disorder of hepatic circulation marked by occlusion of the hepatic veins that leads to liver enlargement, ascites, extensive development of collateral vessels, and severe portal hypertension (</span><span class="CharOverride-3">Dorland’s Medical Dictionary</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> 2023). One code identified the multiple conditions that are known as &#173;Budd-Chiari syndrome, and the individual problems are not coded separately. However, another example of named syndrome is the CHARGE syndrome that the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index presents the code Q89.8, Other specified congenital malformations. However, in the Tabular List, there is a “use additional” code note to identify all associated manifestation. CHARGE syndrome is a syndrome of associated defects, including coloboma of the eye, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, growth retardation, and genital and ear anomalies. Facial palsy, cleft palate, and dysphagia are often present (</span><span class="CharOverride-3">Dorland’s Medical Dictionary</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> 2023). Because code Q89.8 <br />is not strictly “CHARGE syndrome” but instead “other specified congenital malformations,” the coder must assign individual codes for each of the conditions or malformations present <br />in the patient diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-18">Documentation of Complications of Care</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">In Guideline I.B.16 of the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, the coder is given direction on how and when to assign complication codes:</span></p>
			<p class="SL_First ParaOverride-51"><span class="CharOverride-2">Code assignment is based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship between the&#160;&#173;condition and the care or procedure, unless otherwise instructed by the classification. The &#173;guideline extends to any complication of care, regardless of the chapter the code is located in. It is important to note that not all conditions that occur during or following medical care or surgery are classified as complications. There must be a cause-and-effect relationship between the care and the condition, and the documentation must support that the condition is clinically significant. It is not necessary for the provider to explicitly document the term “complication”. For example, if the condition alters the course of the surgery as documented in the operative report, then it would be appropriate to report a complication code. Query the provider for clarification if the documentation is not clear as to the relationship between the condition and the care or procedure (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<p class="Text-flush ParaOverride-56"><span class="CharOverride-2">The important message here is that the physician must document the cause-and-effect &#173;relationship between the medical and surgical care provided and the condition that exists after the care is provided. For example, the surgeon may document the patient has a fever the day <span id="page42" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 42"></span>after a surgical procedure. The coder cannot assume the diagnosis of “postoperative fever” should be coded because the fever is present during the postoperative period. Fever is often expected for a time period after a surgical procedure. The physician would have to identify the fever as a complication with the documentation of fever due to the procedure.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Borderline Diagnosis</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">When the physician uses the adjective of « borderline » with a diagnosis, the coder must consider the meaning of the word borderline by the physician. If the physician documents a “&#173;borderline” diagnosis at the time of discharge, the physician is likely to mean the patient has the &#173;condition but possibly a milder form of the disease than most people would likely experience. A&#160;“&#173;borderline” diagnosis documented at discharge should be coded as a confirmed condition, such as &#173;borderline hyperlipidemia. The coder should confirm that the Alphabetic Index entry for hyperlipidemia does not include a subterm “borderline” that provides a specific code. On the other hand, the term “borderline” may be a specific type of a condition, for example, borderline personality disorder. This is a specific type of a personality disorder. The Alphabetic Index includes an entry of “disorder, personality, borderline” with a specific code of F60.3 provided. In general, the classification system does not represent the severity of a condition present in the patient but rather that the condition is present. There are exceptions to this statement. For example, the diagnosis codes for asthma specify mild, moderate, and severe states. Whenever the coder is uncertain as to the intent of the term “borderline” used by a physician in the &#173;documentation of diagnoses, the coder should query the physician to clarify the diagnosis. Guideline I.B.17 of the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, addresses the coding of diagnoses labeled as “borderline” by the physician in the patient’s health documentation.</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd ParaOverride-35">Use of Sign, Symptom, and Unspecified Codes</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">In Guideline I.B.18 of the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, a statement is made that sign, symptom, and unspecified codes have acceptable, even necessary, uses in coding today. There are occasions when the best information known about a patient is the physical sign or subjective symptom that he or she describes. Every encounter should be coded to the highest level of certainty known about the patient. If the most certain information is the patient complains of abdominal pain but the source of the abdominal pain has not been determined, the best description of that patient at the time is to assign the diagnosis code of abdominal pain for that visit.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The guideline continues by stating, “If a definitive diagnosis has not been established at the end of the encounter, it is appropriate to report codes for sign(s) and/or symptom(s) in lieu of a definitive diagnosis” (CDC 2023). In addition, the guideline states, “When sufficient &#173;clinical information isn’t known or available about a particular health condition to assign a more &#173;specific code, it is acceptable to report the appropriate ‘unspecified’ code.”</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-2">The guideline also states, “Unspecified codes should be reported when they are the codes that most accurately reflect what is known about the patient’s condition at the time of the&#160;encounter. It would be inappropriate to select a specific code that is not supported by the health record documentation or conduct medically unnecessary diagnostic testing in order to determine a more specific code” (CDC 2023).</span></p>
			<h3 class="_-hd">Coding for Healthcare Encounters in Hurricane Aftermath</h3>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-2">In Guideline I.B.19 of the </span><span class="CharOverride-3">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span><span class="CharOverride-2">, guidance has been added for use of external cause of morbidity codes, sequencing of external causes <span id="page43" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 43"></span>of morbidity codes, uses of other external causes of morbidity codes, and Z code use for healthcare encounters in a hurricane aftermath.
