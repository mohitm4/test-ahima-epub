If the P36 code includes the causal organism, an additional code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other bacterial agents as the cause of <br />diseases classified elsewhere, should not be assigned.

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-7">Guideline I.C.16.g. Stillbirth:</span> Code P95, Stillbirth, is only for use in institutions that maintain separate records for stillbirths. No other code should be used with P95. Code P95 should not be used on the mother’s record.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-7">Guideline I.C.16.h. COVID-19 Infection in Newborn:</span> For a newborn that tests positive for COVID-19, assign code U07.1, COVID-19, and the appropriate codes for associated manifestation(s) in <br />neonates/newborns in the absence of documentation indicating a specific type of transmission.  For a newborn that tests positive <br />for COVID-19 and the provider documents the condition was <br />contracted in utero or during the birth process, assign codes P35.8, Other congenital viral diseases, and U07.1, COVID-19. When coding the birth episode in a newborn record, the appropriate code from category Z38, Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of delivery, should be assigned as the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Coding Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal <br />Period in ICD-10-CM Chapter 16</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The introductory notes at the beginning of the chapter provide clarification on how the codes from this chapter should be applied to health records. Codes from this chapter are for use on newborn records only, never on maternal records, and include conditions that have their origin in the fetal or perinatal period (before birth through the first 28 days after birth) even if morbidity occurs later. Coding Guideline I.C.16.a.1 further states that Chapter 16 codes may be used throughout the life of the patient if the condition is still present. Coding Guideline I.C.16.a.4 clarifies those conditions originating in the perinatal period, and continuing throughout the life of the patient, would have perinatal codes assigned regardless of the patient’s age.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Although the perinatal period lasts through 28 days following birth, the codes within Chapter 15 may be assigned beyond that period when the condition still exists. However, the <span id="page539" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 539"></span>condition must have its origin in the perinatal period, even though it could continue to affect the patient beyond that time.</span></p>
			<p class="XM_first ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-4">EXAMPLE:</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-1">A six-month-old was admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory failure </span><span class="CharOverride-1">due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia: J96.00, Acute respiratory failure; P27.1, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia originating in the perinatal period.</span></p>

Although this patient is no longer in the perinatal period, the BPD is still present and, as such, should be coded. BPD occurs commonly in infants who had respiratory distress syndrome at birth, as well as in those who have required endotracheal intubation and a respirator for many days.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Codes in Chapter 16 identify newborns affected by maternal factors, disorders related to length of gestation and fetal growth, abnormal findings on neonatal screening, birth trauma, infections, and respiratory, cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, endocrine, and digestive conditions that originate in the perinatal period.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd">Newborn Affected by Maternal Factors and by Complications of Pregnancy, Labor, and Delivery (P00–P04)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">These codes are used on the newborn or individual’s record when a maternal condition is identified as the cause of the newborn or person’s condition or possible condition and it originated in the perinatal period. For example, code P00.82 describes a newborn affected by (positive) maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization.  The mother can pass GBS to her baby during delivery and produce an infection in the infant, however, not every baby becomes ill. On occasion, the newborn may be described as suspected of having a problem. The healthcare provider may describe the conditions as “suspected,” and after an investigation, it may be determined that the condition does not exist or the physician may state that the condition is “ruled out.” Codes for the “suspected” but ruled out conditions come from category Z05 instead of the P00–P04 codes.</span></p>

When both birth weight and gestational age are available, the coders should assign two codes from category P07, with the code for birth weight sequenced first. The code for gestational age is sequenced following the birth weight code. The code for the birth weight does not specify the gestational age and likewise for the gestational age codes. Both provide valuable information about the infant. Weeks of gestation may be predictive of the probability, but not a guarantee, of developmental problems for the infant in the future.

Bacterial sepsis is the presence of bacteria in the blood of the infant. This produces an invasive infection, which is demonstrated in the infant having apnea, bradycardia, low temperature, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, seizure, jaundice, and jitteriness. It is treated with intravenous antibiotics and is more common in low-birth-weight babies (Tesini 2022). Unique codes exist for septicemia or sepsis of newborn due to various organisms such as streptococcus group B, other streptococci, </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Staphylococcus aureus</span><span class="CharOverride-1">, as well as sepsis due to </span><span class="CharOverride-2">Escherichia coli</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> and anaerobes. Because these codes include the causal organism, an additional code from categories <br />B95–B96, Bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, is not needed. However, if the P36 code does not include the causal organism, the coder should assign an additional code from category B96. If the infant has severe sepsis, the coder should use <span id="page545" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 545"></span>additional codes to identify severe sepsis (R65.2-) and any associated acute organ dysfunction.</span></p>

The Z38 category codes in ICD-10-CM identify the number of liveborn infants, where they are born (in hospital, outside hospital), and how they were delivered (vaginally or by cesarean). Other codes exist for twin, triplet, quadruplet, quintuplet, and other multiple liveborn infants. For example, the birth record for a single liveborn infant, born in the hospital, and delivered vaginally is code Z38.00. The birth record for a twin liveborn infant, born in the hospital, delivered by cesarean is code Z38.31. A code from category Z38 is assigned only once to a newborn at the time of birth. If the newborn is transferred to another institution or readmitted to the hospital, a code from category Z38 should not be used at the next hospital. The Z38 codes are located in the Index under the main term “newborn” with subterms of born in hospital, twin, triplet, quadruplet, and quintuplet.</span></p>
