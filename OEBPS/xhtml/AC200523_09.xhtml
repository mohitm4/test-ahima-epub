			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A number of codes include a combination of conditions, such as persistent migraine aura with cerebral infarction, intractable (G43.61-). Additionally, a number of codes for diseases of the nervous system include facts concerning the onset of the disease. For example, G30.0, Alzheimer’s disease with early onset, and G30.1, Alzheimer’s disease with late onset, are available in ICD-10-CM. ICD-10-CM has codes for the nervous system diseases that exist with and without associated symptoms. For example, there are two codes for phantom limb &#173;syndrome, differentiating whether pain is present or not (G54.6–G54.7).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Classification of sleep disorders is included in Chapter 6 instead of in the signs and &#173;symptoms chapter. Sleep apnea has its own subcategory with fifth-character specificity &#173;identifying the type.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Epilepsy and recurrent seizures are classified to category G40 in ICD-10-CM.

Coders must follow the Alphabetic Index entries cautiously to distinguish these diagnoses when coding.</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-4">Coding Guidelines and Instructional Notes <br />for ICD-10-CM Chapter 6</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">At the start of Chapter 6 in ICD-10-CM, a series of excluded conditions are listed that are applicable to all conditions classifiable to Chapter 6. For example, at the start of Chapter 6 of ICD-10-CM, there is an Excludes2 note that states conditions from other chapters can be used in addition to the codes for diseases of the nervous system. For example, if the patient also has certain conditions originating in the perinatal period, codes from categories P04–P96 may be assigned with the nervous system condition.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Throughout the chapter, there are instructional notes to “use additional code to identify organism,” “code first underlying disease,” “use additional code for adverse effect, if applicable, to identify drug,” and “code also any associated condition” (CDC 2023).

Figure 9.3 illustrates the layers of the cerebral meninges. The three layers of the meninges are the dura mater, pia mater, and arachnoid membrane. The most common type of &#173;meningitis is viral meningitis. Bacterial meningitis occurs less frequently than does viral meningitis and can be life threatening. The pia mater and the arachnoid membrane can be inflamed by &#173;bacterial </span><span class="CharOverride-1">meningitis (</span><span class="CharOverride-1">Mosby 2022). Both conditions can start with a cold-like infection. The infection </span><span class="CharOverride-1">can damage blood vessels in the brain and lead to a stroke and cause other organ damage. Pneumococcal and meningococcal infections can cause bacterial meningitis. Symptoms of meningitis include a sudden fever, stiff neck, and headache. </span><span class="CharOverride-1">Meningitis can progress rapidly but can be treated to prevent serious complications including </span><span class="CharOverride-1">death. Since meningitis frequently occurs in adolescents and young adults living in dorms or in close contact in schools, many physicians recommend vaccinations to prevent some of the bacterial infections that can cause meningitis (NLM 2023a).

The patient’s relatives may first notice a loss of the patient’s memory of recent events. Memory loss by itself does not establish the diagnosis of dementia. However, if a patient has other symptoms such as language difficulties and the ability to carry out normal everyday functions, the diagnosis of dementia is more likely to be made. Patients with dementia can have difficulty handling their financial responsibilities, such as writing checks, or taking care of their home, such as cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, and laundry. As the disease progresses, the patients may lose their problem-solving thought processes and may have personality changes. Patients with dementia may become agitated and experience visual delusions, such as seeing objects that are not present. Another symptom is memory loss that progresses from mild to severe. Patients with dementia may not recognize loved ones as their disease progresses and lose their ability to express themselves or to even speak (NLM 2023b).</span></p>

Codes from category G89 can be reported with codes that identify the site of the pain, including symptom codes from the ICD-10-CM body system or symptoms chapters, if the category G89 code provides additional information. For example, if a code from the body system <br />or &#173;symptoms chapters identifies the site of the pain but does not describe the pain as acute or chronic, both codes should be assigned.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The sequencing of category G89 codes with site-specific pain codes depends on the &#173;circumstances of the admission or outpatient visit. For example, if the patient is being seen in the Pain Clinic to treat his neoplasm-related pain in the lumbar region of his back due to the bone metastatic carcinoma from his prostate carcinoma, the first-listed code would be the code G89.3, neoplasm-related pain, followed by codes for lumbar region pain, M54.50; carcinoma of prostate, C61; and secondary carcinoma of bone, C79.51. If the patient was in the Oncology Clinic for the management of his carcinoma of the prostate and also complains of the lumbar back pain that is attributed to the bone metastasis in the lumbar vertebrae, code C61 for the carcinoma of the prostate would be listed as the first diagnosis with the other diagnoses listed as additional diagnosis codes.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">If the encounter is for pain control or pain management, the code from category G89 is sequenced first, followed by the code for the specific site of the pain or the underlying cause of the pain, if known. For example, assume a patient with known displacement of lumbar intervertebral disc is seen in the Pain Clinic for management of his chronic low back pain secondary to displacement of the lumbar intervertebral disc. For this encounter, the chronic pain, G89.29, would be listed first with an additional code, M51.26, for the underlying condition of the displacement of the lumbar intervertebral disc.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">When an admission or encounter is for a procedure aimed at treating the underlying condition, a code for the underlying condition should be assigned as the principal or first-listed diagnosis. No code from category G89 should be assigned. For example, assume a patient with known displacement of lumbar intervertebral disc and chronic back pain due to the displaced disc is admitted for a laminectomy with excision of the herniated intervertebral disc. This patient’s principal diagnosis is the displacement of the lumbar intervertebral disc, M51.26.</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Cerebral Palsy, Category G80</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-8">Cerebral palsy</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> is one of a group of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood. The condition permanently affects body movement and muscle coordination but usually does not worsen as the person ages. It is thought to be caused by abnormalities in parts of the brain that control muscle movements. The most common signs are a lack of muscle coordination when trying to walk, stiff muscles, dragging one leg or foot when walking, and exaggerated reflexes or spasticity. Other suspected causes of cerebral palsy are brain damage that occurs in the first few months of life, for example, from a fall, motor vehicle accident, or child abuse. Bacterial or viral meningitis in a young child may also be a cause of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy produces varying degrees of disability. One patient may be unable to walk and require lifelong care. Another person may have difficulty walking but does not require special assistance and leads a normal life. Fourth-digit subcategories identify the different forms of </span><span class="CharOverride-1">infantile cerebral palsy, such as spastic quadriplegic, spastic diplegic, spastic hemiplegic, athe</span><span class="CharOverride-1">toid, </span><span class="CharOverride-1"><br />ataxic, or other forms of cerebral palsy (NINDS 2023).</span></p>

			<p class="_-hd">Hemiplegia and Hemiparesis, Category G81</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">The terms </span><span class="CharOverride-8">hemiplegia</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> and </span><span class="CharOverride-8">hemiparesis</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> both refer to the paralysis of either the left side or the right side of the body. Paralysis is the loss of muscle function. Hemiplegia can be complete on one side of the body that affects both arm and leg or partial when only the arm or leg affected on one side of the body. Most hemiplegia is the result of a stroke or an injury such as a spinal cord injury (NLM 2023d).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Category G81 has fourth- and fifth-digit subcategories that differentiate between flaccid and spastic hemiplegia. Flaccid refers to the loss of muscle tone in the paralyzed parts with the absence of tendon reflexes, whereas spastic refers to the spasticity of the paralyzed parts with increased tendon reflexes. The G81 codes often are assigned when the health record provides no further information, when the cause of the hemiplegia and hemiparesis is unknown, or as an additional code when the condition results from a specified cause.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A note on how to use the codes in the categories G81 (Hemiplegia and hemiparesis), G82 </span><span class="CharOverride-1">(Paraplegia and quadriplegia), and G83 (Other paralytic syndromes) is provided: the catego</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ries are to be used only when the listed conditions are reported without further specification or are stated to be old or long-standing but of unspecified cause. The category is also for use in multiple coding to identify these conditions resulting from any cause. Paralytic sequelae of cerebral infarct/stroke are in ICD-10-CM Chapter 9: Diseases of the Circulatory System. An example of the use of the hemiplegia codes with another condition is when a patient has a cerebral infarction that produces dominant right-sided flaccid hemiplegia:</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A fifth-digit subclassification is included in category G81–G83 to identify whether the dominant or nondominant side of the body is affected. This type of specificity may not be available in the health record; if the information is not available, assign the fifth digit 0. However, if the affected side is documented but not specified as the dominant or nondominant side for the patient, and the classification does not provide a default code, the code is based on I.C.6.a. Diseases of the Nervous System, Dominant/Nondominant side.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Codes from category G81, Hemiplegia and hemiparesis, and subcategories G83.2, Monoplegia of upper limb, and G83.3, Monoplegia, unspecified, identify whether the &#173;dominant or nondominant side is affected. Should the affected side be documented, but not specified as dominant or nondominant, and the classification system does not indicate a default, code selection is as follows:</span></p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">An instructional note appears under the category heading G40, Epilepsy and recurrent sei</span><span class="CharOverride-1">zures; it explains that terminology that is the same as “intractable” may be documented as pharmacoresistant, pharmacologically resistant, treatment resistant, refractory, medically refractory, and poorly controlled. If the physician uses any of these terms, the coder can assign the ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for the intractable form of the disease (CDC 2023).</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Physicians often document “recurrent seizure” or “seizure disorder” as well as epilepsy in a health record. Recurrent seizures or seizure disorders are classified in the same category as epilepsy because the terminology is synonymous in medicine. Localization-related epilepsy is the terminology used today for an older term, partial epilepsy.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Other terms used to describe convulsions are not classified to category G40. Such phrases as convulsion or convulsive disorder, convulsive seizures, fits, or recurrent convulsions are not accepted as equivalent to epilepsy or recurrent seizures. Instead, the codes for the convulsive conditions are included in category R56 within ICD-10-CM Chapter 18 for symptoms. The term seizure and the plural term seizures are also coded to the symptom code R56.9 by following the Alphabetic Index carefully. Coders must not use the terms seizures and convulsions interchangeably. By using the physician’s description of the patient’s condition and following the Alphabetic Index precisely, different terminology will produce different ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. Conditions documented as convulsions, posttraumatic seizures, seizures, and convulsive seizures are not coded to category G40, Epilepsy and recurrent seizures. Instead, these conditions are coded to category R56, Convulsions, not elsewhere classified.

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-8">Migraine</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> headaches are recurrent headaches that produce moderate to severe head pain for the patient. The pain may be pulsing or throbbing and may appear on only one side of the head. In addition to pain, the patient often experiences nausea and vomiting. The patient prefers to rest in a darkened, quiet room as light and sound exacerbate the patient’s symptoms. Some patients experience what is called an “aura,” that is, a warning to the patient that he or she is <span id="page254" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 254"></span>about to have a migraine headache. The aura may be flashing lights or zigzag lines that the patient sees in the patient’s visual field. Some patients have momentary loss of vision during their aura stage. Some research has suggested that migraines may be linked to the alternating dilation and narrowing of blood vessels in the brain. Migraines may be an inherited condition and have a genetic component that affects the activity of brain cells. Some medications have helped to prevent the severity of migraine attacks, while other medications relieve the symptoms that patients with migraines experience. Some patients experience migraines for most of their adult life, while other patients report fewer migraines as the person ages (NLM 2023c).</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">The classification of migraine headaches is reported with category codes G43, Migraine. Many types of migraine headaches can be identified with specific codes in subcategories for migraine with aura, migraine without aura, hemiplegic migraine, persistent migraine aura with and without cerebral infarction, chronic migraine, and other forms of migraine.

The guideline extends to any complication of care, regardless of the chapter the code is located in. It is important to note that not all conditions that occur during or following medical care or surgery are classified as complications. There must be a cause-and-effect relationship between the care provided and the condition, and the documentation must support that the condition is clinically significant. It is not necessary for the provider to explicitly document the term “complication.” For example, if the condition alters the course of the surgery as documented in the operative report, then it would be appropriate to report a complication code. Query the provider for clarification if the documentation is not clear as to the relationship between the condition and the care or procedure (CDC 2023).</span></p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">One frequently performed procedure in the central nervous system is the creation of a shunt to drain fluid from one site to another cavity. For example, shunting from the cerebral ventricle to a peritoneal location is coded as a </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Bypass</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> in ICD-10-PCS. Guideline B3.6a includes the instruction that a bypass procedure is coded using the body part that is the origin of the shunt in the fourth character code of the code and the destination of the shunt in the seventh character (qualifier). Bypass procedures therefore are coded as from a body part to another body part.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Procedures frequently performed on the peripheral nervous system include Release, Repair, Reposition, and Transfer procedures. The Index entries for </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Release</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> include a subterm of “nerve” with the peripheral nerves as well as other nerves listed beneath it. A Release procedure involves freeing a nerve from a body part from an abnormal physical constraint. The three-digit code for release of a peripheral nerve is 01N. The fourth character identifies the nerve released, such as ulnar, median, radial, and such. The approach choices are Open, Percutaneous, or Percutaneous Endoscopic. There is no device or qualifier option in this table, as neither will apply to this type of procedure.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1"> A </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Repair</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> of a nerve involves restoring the nerve to the extent possible or &#173;restoring the nerve to its normal anatomic structure and function. The broad terms of neuroplasty or &#173;neurorrhaphy refer the coder to the root operations of Repair and Supplement. The suture repair of a nerve is coded as a Repair. Root Operation Supplement of a nerve would involve an autologous tissue substitute to reinforce the nerve structure.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Other procedures performed on nerves may be described as a transposition. Transposition is not a root operation in ICD-10-PCS. Instead, the Index refers the coder to the root &#173;operations of Reposition or Transfer </span><span class="CharOverride-1">for a transposition of a nerve. A </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Reposition</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> of a nerve involves moving it to its normal location or other suitable location all of a portion of the nerve. Under the main term Reposition in the Index, the coder will find a subterm of nerve with specific nerves listed beneath it. Table 01S for Reposition of a peripheral nerve includes the identified nerve as the fourth body part character. The approach for a Reposition is Open, Percutaneous, or Percutaneous Endoscopic. There is no applicable value for the sixth or seventh characters of device or qualifier.</span></p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">A nerve transfer is coded to the root operation </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Transfer</span><span class="CharOverride-1">. In ICD-10-PCS, a nerve transfer is the moving, without taking it out, all of a portion of the nerve to another location to take over the function of all or a portion of the nerve. Transfer is a main term in the Index with nerve as a subterm and the specific nerves listed with the three-digit code table 01X. Again, the “from” and “to” concept is used for transfers with the body part used for the nerve transferred from and the qualifier as the nerve transferred to. There are two choices for the approach used, that is, Open and Percutaneous Endoscopic, and there is no choice for a device as it does not apply.</span></p>
