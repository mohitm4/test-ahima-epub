			<p class="Text">The terminology used to describe several cardiovascular conditions has been revised to reflect more current medical practice. For example, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is identified as <span class="CharOverride-1">ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)</span>, or Type 1 ST elevation myocardial infarction, and <span class="CharOverride-1">non-ST myocardial infarction elevation (NSTEMI</span>), or Type 1 non-ST <br />myocardial infarction. A STEMI is a myocardial infarction in which the ST segment is elevated in one lead or several leads. The ST segment on an electrocardiogram is the interval <br />from the end of the ventricular depolarization to the onset of the T wave and is usually isoelectric in normal patients (Dorland 2023). An NSTEMI may also be referred to as a &#173;non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, subendocardial myocardial infarction, or a nontransmural myocardial infarction. This is a type of myocardial infarction that involves less than the full thickness of the myocardial wall (Dorland 2023). Type 2 through Type 5 myocardial infarctions are included in category I21.A, Other type myocardial infarction. Intermediate coronary syndrome is identified in ICD-10-CM as unstable angina (CDC 2023). Acute coronary occlusion without myocardial infarction is better classified in ICD-10-CM as acute coronary <span id="page307" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 307"></span>thrombosis not resulting in myocardial infarction. Hypertension codes do not identify the type of hypertension such as benign, malignant, or unspecified. There is only one code for <br />essential hypertension (I10). Hypertensive crisis, also known as hypertensive urgency or emergency, is identified with category code I16.</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">At the beginning of Chapter 9, a series of excluded conditions are listed that are applicable to all conditions classifiable to Chapter 9. For example, the Excludes2 note includes conditions that can be coded with codes from Chapter 9. Such conditions include but are not limited to certain conditions originating in the perinatal period, certain infectious and parasitic diseases, and complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium.</p>
			<p class="Text">Under several blocks of codes including hypertensive disease (I10–I16) and ischemic heart disease (I20–I25), there are “use additional code to identify” notes to code exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, history of tobacco use, occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, tobacco dependence, and tobacco use.</p>
			<p class="Text">Other codes, including cardiomyopathy in diseases classified elsewhere (I43) and paroxysmal tachycardia (I47), include “code first” notes, such as underlying diseases of amyloidosis; glycogen storage disease; gout and thyrotoxicosis; or tachycardia complicating abortion, ectopic, or molar pregnancy, and obstetric surgery and procedures.</p>
			<p class="Text">The NCHS has published chapter-specific guidelines for Chapter 9 in the <span class="CharOverride-2">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</span>. The coding student should review all of the coding guidelines for Chapter 9 of ICD-10-CM, which appear in an ICD-10-CM code book, on the CDC website (CDC 2023) or in appendix F.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.a.2. Hypertensive Chronic Kidney Disease:</span> Assign codes from category I12, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, when both hypertension and a condition classifiable to category N18, Chronic kidney disease (CKD), are present. CKD should not be coded as hypertensive if the provider indicates the CKD is not related to the hypertension.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.a.4. Hypertensive Cerebrovascular Disease:</span> For hypertensive cerebrovascular disease, first assign the appropriate code from categories I60–I69, followed by the appropriate hypertension code.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.a.5. Hypertensive Retinopathy:</span> Subcategory I35.0, Background retinopathy and retinal vascular changes, should be used along with a code from category I10-I15, in the Hypertensive disease section, to include the systemic hypertension. The sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.a.6. Hypertension, Secondary:</span> Secondary <br />hypertension is due to an underlying condition. Two codes are required: one to identify the underlying etiology and one from category I15 to identify the hypertension. Sequencing of codes is determined by the reason for admission/encounter.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.a.12 Hypertension, Resistant:</span> Resistant hypertension refers to blood pressure of a patient with hypertension that remains above goal in spite of the use of antihypertensive medications. Assign code I1A.0, Resistant hypertension, as an additional code when apparent treatment resistant hypertension, treatment resistant hypertension, or true resistant hypertension is documented by the provider. A code for the specific type of existing hypertension is sequenced first, if known.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.b. Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease and Angina:</span> ICD-10-CM has combination codes for atherosclerotic heart disease with angina pectoris. The subcategories for these codes are I25.11, Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris and I25.7, Atherosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft(s) and coronary artery of transplanted heart with angina pectoris.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">When using one of these combination codes it is not necessary to use an additional code for angina pectoris. A causal relationship can be assumed in a patient with both atherosclerosis and angina pectoris, unless the documentation indicates the angina is due to something other than atherosclerosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">If a patient with coronary artery disease is admitted due to an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the AMI should be sequenced before the coronary artery disease.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.c Intraoperative and Postprocedural </span><span class="CharOverride-3">Cerebrovascular Accident:</span> Medical record documentation should clearly specify the cause-and-effect relationship between the medical intervention and the cerebrovascular accident in order to assign a code for intraoperative or postprocedural cerebrovascular accident.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8">Proper code assignment depends on whether it was an infarction or hemorrhage and whether it occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively. If it was a cerebral hemorrhage, code assignment depends on the type of procedure performed.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.9.d.1. Category I69, Sequelae of Cerebrovascular Disease:</span> Category I69 is used to indicate conditions classifiable to categories I60–I67 as the causes of sequela (neurologic deficits), themselves classified elsewhere. These “late effects” include neurologic deficits that persist after initial onset of conditions classifiable to categories I60–I67. The neurologic deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease may be present from the onset or may arise at any time after the onset of the condition classifiable to categories I60–I67.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">Codes from category I69, Sequelae of cerebrovascular disease, that specify hemiplegia, hemiparesis and monoplegia identify whether the dominant or nondominant side is affected. Should <span id="page311" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 311"></span>the affected side be documented, but not specified as dominant or nondominant, and the classification system does not indicate a default, code selection is as follows:</p>

Type 1 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI):</span> The ICD-10-CM codes for type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) identify the site, such as anterolateral wall or true posterior wall. Subcategories I21.0–I21.2 and code I21.3 are used for type 1 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Code I21.4, Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, is used for type 1 non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and nontransmural MIs.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt">If a type 1 NSTEMI evolves to STEMI, assign the STEMI code. If a type 1 STEMI converts to NSTEMI due to thrombolytic therapy, it is still coded as a STEMI.</p>

For encounters after the 4-week time frame and the patient is still receiving care related to the myocardial infarction, the appropriate aftercare code should be assigned, rather than a code from category I21. For old or healed myocardial infarctions not requiring further care, code I25.2, Old myocardial infarction, may be assigned.</p>

The acute phase of the illness is marked by fever, malaise, sweating, palpitation, and polyarthritis, which varies from vague discomfort to severe pain felt chiefly in the large joints. Most patients have elevated titers of antistreptolysin antibodies and increased sedimentation rates (CDC 2022).</p>
			<p class="Text">The importance of rheumatic fever derives entirely from its capacity to cause severe heart damage. Salicylates markedly reduce fever, relieve joint pain, and may reduce joint swelling, if present. Because rheumatic fever often recurs, prophylaxis with penicillin is recommended and has markedly reduced the incidence of rheumatic heart disease in the general population.</p>

Chorea is the result of acute rheumatic fever but may not be evident for as long as six months after the original streptococcal infection. It can be present with or without rheumatic fever damage to the heart. A patient with rheumatic chorea will have a variety of symptoms including muscle weakness, difficulty in gripping objects, difficulty walking, and a slurred or garbled speech pattern. Psychological symptoms may be present with the physical signs. The patient may have emotional displays that are out of proportion with the events occurring around the patient. The patient may also have attention deficits, experience anxiety when separated from parents or caregivers, and have some obsessive-compulsive tendencies. In adult women, poststreptococcal chorea may complicate pregnancy, known as chorea gravidarum (NLM 2023b).</p>

			<p class="Text"><span class="CharOverride-1">Rheumatic heart disease</span> develops with an initial attack of rheumatic fever. It is thought that the degree of heart inflammation from rheumatic fever determines whether patients develop rheumatic heart disease. About 1 percent of people who had no heart inflammation with the initial rheumatic fever develop rheumatic heart disease. However, about 30 percent of patients who had mild heart inflammation and 70 percent of patients who had severe heart inflammation develop rheumatic heart disease (Weinberg 2021). The cardiac involvement may affect all three layers of the heart muscle, causing pericarditis, scarring and weakening of the myocardium, and endocardial involvement of heart valves. The latter condition occurs more often in children who have had rheumatic fever and, to a lesser extent, in adults with rheumatic fever. A murmur heard over the heart is symptomatic of a valvular lesion. Rheumatic fever causes inflammation of the valves, thus damaging the valve cusps so that the opening may become permanently narrowed (stenosis). The mitral valve is involved in the great majority of such cases; the aortic valve is involved to a lesser extent; and the tricuspid and pulmonary valves are involved in a small percentage of the patients (Weinberg 2021).</p>

			<p class="Text">When stenosis affects the mitral valve, blood flow decreases from the left atrium into the left ventricle. As a result, blood is held back in the lungs, then in the right side of the heart, and, finally, in the veins of the body. Incompetence of a valve may also occur because the cusps will not retract. If the mitral valve cannot close, blood escapes from the mitral valve back into the left atrium. In the case of the aortic valve, blood escapes from the aorta into the left ventricle. In such cases, plastic and metal replacement valves that function as well as normal valves may be surgically inserted.</p>

Usually, a person with malignant hypertension will complain of headaches and difficulties with vision. Blood pressures of 180/120 are common, and an abnormal protrusion of the optic nerve (papilledema) occurs with microscopic hemorrhages and exudates seen in the retina. The initial event appears to be some form of vascular damage to the kidneys.

Beneath category code I15 is an instructional note to “code also underlying condition.” The sequencing of the two codes depends on the circumstances of the visit or admission, that is, what the primary focus of attention is. The codes in category I15 include a broad description of the underlying cause:</p>

The I16 category code would be used with another code that identifies the type of hypertensive disease the patient has from categories I10–I15. Depending on the circumstances of the admission or visit, the I10–I15 code may be listed first or the I16 code may be listed first. For example, if the patient was admitted because of a hypertensive emergency due to the patient’s essential hypertension, the principal diagnosis is likely to be I16.1 with a secondary diagnosis code of I10 (CDC 2023).</p>

			<p class="_-hd">Angina Pectoris</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Angina pectoris</span> refers to chest pain due to ischemia (loss of blood supply to a part) of the heart. The blood flow, with its supply of oxygen, is reduced because of atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries). Immediate causes of angina pectoris can be exertion, stress, cold weather, or digestion of a large meal. Pain is most commonly felt beneath the sternum, and a vague or a sharp pain sometimes radiates down the left arm. Blood pressure and heart rate are increased during an attack; however, angina lasts only a few minutes and is relieved by rest and/or sublingual nitroglycerin. Angina pectoris is a warning of more severe heart disease, such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure (Alaeddini 2018).</p>
			<p class="Text">ICD-10-CM classifies angina pectoris to category I20. The fourth-digit subcategories identify specific types of angina pectoris, such as angina pectoris with documented spasm, which may also be described as Prinzmetal angina, variant angina, or spasm-induced angina (I20.1). The definition of Prinzmetal or variant angina is chest pain at rest secondary to myocardial ischemia. Other forms of angina pectoris are classified as I20.8 and may be described as stable angina, angina equivalent, or coronary slow flow syndrome. There is also a code&#160;I20.9 for angina pectoris NOS or angina NOS, which may also be described <br />as ischemic chest pain.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">ICD-10-CM has combination codes for atherosclerotic heart disease with angina pectoris. The subcategories for these codes are I25.11, Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris, and I25.7, Atherosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft(s) and coronary artery of transplanted heart with angina pectoris. When using one of these combination codes, it is not necessary to use an additional code for angina pectoris. A causal <span id="page321" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 321"></span>relationship can be assumed in a patient with both atherosclerosis and angina pectoris, unless the documentation indicates the angina is due to something other than atherosclerosis. If a patient with coronary artery disease is admitted due to an AMI, the AMI should be sequenced before the coronary artery disease as these are two separate clinical conditions. When angina is present with atherosclerotic heart disease, the ICD-10-CM Index to Diseases and Injuries provides the following direction to indicate that a combination code will be used to describe the angina with atherosclerotic heart disease:</p>

			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)</span> usually occurs as a result of a sudden inadequacy of coronary flow. The first symptom of AMI is the development of deep substernal pain described as aching or pressure, often with radiation to the back or left arm. The patient may be pale, diaphoretic (sweaty), and in severe pain; however, the symptoms may vary between men and women. Peripheral or carotid cyanosis may be present, as well as arrhythmias. Treatment is <br />designed to relieve the patient’s distress, reduce cardiac work, and prevent and treat complications. Major complications include tachycardia, frequent ventricular premature beats, heart block, and ventricular fibrillation. Heart failure often occurs. Physicians may refer to an AMI as a type 1 STEMI or type 1 NSTEMI (NHLBI 2022a).</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">Included under category I21, type 1 STEMI and type 1 NSTEMI myocardial infarction, is the terminology of cardiac infarction, coronary (artery) embolism, coronary (artery) occlusion, coronary (artery) rupture, coronary (artery) thrombosis, and infarction of heart, myocardium, or ventricle. This code is intended to represent a myocardial infarction specified as acute or with a stated duration of four weeks (28 days) or less from onset. Specific ICD-10-CM coding guidelines exist for the coding of current and subsequent type 1 AMIs with AMI complication codes and likely will challenge new ICD-10-CM coders as they begin to use the classification system. Also included in codes I21.A1-I21.A9 are other types of myocardial infarctions, such as myocardial infarction type 2 that is also known as myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia or ischemic imbalance. This occurs when a condition other than coronary artery disease results in an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand. A “code also” note appears under code I21.A1 to identify the underlying cause, if known and applicable. Other types of myocardial infarction are known as type 3, type 4 and type 5 that occur from presumed cardiac etiology or associated with revascularization procedures. A “code first” and “code also” note appear under code I21.A9 to identify a postprocedural myocardial infarction or a cardiac complication if known and applicable.</p>

			<span id="page324" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 324"></span>
			<p class="Text">Diagnostic uncertainty frequently arises because of various factors. Many patients with acute AMI have atypical symptoms.

Laboratory tests known as biochemical or serum markers of cardiac injury are commonly relied upon to diagnose or exclude an AMI.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase have been the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of AMI for many years.

In order to be effective, tPA must be given within the first three hours after the onset of symptoms. The fact that a patient has received tPA is important information. A patient may be seen in Hospital A and receive tPA intravenously and then be transferred to Hospital B for further management of the AMI. If the patient has received tPA within the 24 hours prior to admission to the current facility, then the coder at Hospital B should code Z92.82, Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to the current facility. The condition requiring the tPA administration is coded first, such as acute MI or acute cerebral infarction. Hospital A does not use diagnosis code Z92.82.</p>

The large arteries—the aorta and its main branches—are primarily affected, but smaller arteries such as the coronary and cerebral arteries can also be affected. In such a case, the patient experiences chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. Blood pressure is high; pulse is rapid and weak. An x-ray reveals cardiomegaly and narrowing, or occlusion, of the affected vessel wall. Blood tests may show hypercholesterolemia.</p>

This condition may be caused by coronary artery disease (usually in a patient with a previous myocardial infarction), cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or heart valve disease. Sometimes the exact cause of heart failure is not found. Heart failure may develop gradually or occur acutely. Heart failure can involve the heart’s left side, right side, or both sides. However, it usually affects the left side first.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">Heart failure causes blood to flow in and out of the heart at a slower rate. At the same time, this causes blood in the veins trying to return to the heart to slow down, and congestion in the body tissues occurs. Patients with heart failure with this congestion have swelling in the legs, ankles, wrists, and hands. Fluid also collects in the lungs, and the patient will experience shortness of breath, especially pronounced when the person is lying down. Physicians describe the pulmonary congestion as pulmonary edema that must be treated before it produces respiratory distress or respiratory failure. The kidneys’ ability to filter and dispose of waste is hampered by heart failure. The body retains water when the kidneys are not functioning properly, and swelling occurs in other parts of the body than strictly the extremities. The same condition may be referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">congestive heart failure, </span>left-sided heart failure, or <br />right-sided heart failure (NHLBI 2022b).</p>

			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-59">Left-Sided Heart Failure</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The heart’s pumping action moves oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium and then on to the left ventricle, which pumps it to the rest of the body. The left ventricle supplies most of the heart’s pumping power, so it is larger than the other chambers and essential for normal function. In left-sided or left ventricular (LV) heart failure, the left side of the heart must work harder to pump the same amount of blood.</p>
			<span id="page329" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 329"></span>
			<p class="Text">There are two types of <span class="CharOverride-1">left-sided heart failure</span>. Drug treatments are different for the two types.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-3">Systolic failure: The left ventricle loses its ability to contract normally. The heart cannot pump with sufficient force to push enough blood into circulation.</li>
				<li class="Bull-list-flush ParaOverride-26">Diastolic failure: The left ventricle loses its ability to relax normally (because the muscle has become stiff). The heart cannot properly fill with blood during the resting period between each beat.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Text">In addition to systolic and diastolic failure, the condition may be described as acute or chronic or acute on chronic. The coder must follow the ICD-10-CM Index to Diseases and Injuries carefully. For example, the various types of acute or chronic diastolic heart failure include the entries as follows:</p>
			<p class="IL_Mid ParaOverride-60">Failure,</p>

			<p class="IL_Mid-5"><span class="CharOverride-8">and (on) acute (congestive) I50.43</span></p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-29">Right-Sided Heart Failure</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">The heart’s pumping action also moves deoxygenated blood, which returns through the veins to the heart, through the right atrium, and into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps the blood back out of the heart into the lungs to be replenished with oxygen.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-1">Right-sided heart failure</span> usually occurs as a result of left-sided failure. When the left ventricle fails, increased fluid pressure is, in effect, transferred back through the lungs, ultimately damaging the heart’s right side. When the right side loses pumping power, blood backs up in the body’s veins. This usually causes swelling in the legs and ankles.</p>
			<p class="XMS_first ParaOverride-61"><span class="CharOverride-1">EXAMPLE:</span>&#9;The attending physician documented in the discharge summary of his patient’s record that the patient was treated for right ventricular heart failure.

			<p class="_-hd">Diagnostic Tests</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Several diagnostic tests are important in diagnosing heart failure in a patient. Typical remarks on a chest x-ray indicating heart failure include hilar congestion, “butterfly” or “batwing” appearance of vascular markings, bronchial edema, Kerley B lines signifying chronic &#173;elevation of left atrial pressure, and heart enlargement. An echocardiograph measures the amount of blood pumped from the heart with each beat. This measurement is known as the ejection &#173;fraction. A normal heart pumps one half (50 percent) or more of the blood in the left ventricle with each heartbeat. With heart failure, the weakened heart may pump 40 percent or less, and less blood is pumped with less force to all parts of the body.</p>
			<p class="Text">In a patient with heart failure, a urine test shows evidence of heart failure with the presence of slight albuminuria, increased concentration with specific gravity of 1.020, and decreased urine sodium. Laboratory findings may include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 60 mg/100 mL; acidosis, pH 7.35 due to increased CO<span class="CharOverride-9">2</span> in blood from pulmonary insufficiency; and increased blood volume with decrease in chloride, albumin, and total protein.</p>
			<p class="Text">For most patients, heart failure is a chronic condition, which means it can be treated and managed, but not cured. Usually, the patient’s management plan consists of medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; diuretics and digitalis; low-sodium diet; possibly some modifications in daily activities; regular exercise such as walking and swimming; and other changes in lifestyle and health habits such as reducing alcohol consumption and quitting smoking.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-1">Sick sinus syndrome (SSS)</span> (I49.5) is an imprecise diagnosis with various characteristics. SSS may be diagnosed when a patient presents with sinus arrest, sinoatrial exit block, or persistent sinus bradycardia. This syndrome is often the result of drug therapy, such as digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, sympatholytic agents, or antiarrhythmics. Another presentation includes recurrent supraventricular tachycardias associated with bradyarrhythmias. Prolonged ambulatory monitoring may be indicated to establish a diagnosis of SSS. Treatment includes insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker.</p>

Tachycardia is also a response to stimulants such as caffeine, cocaine, or amphetamines. Treatment is geared toward correcting the underlying cause. ICD-10-CM classifies supraventricular tachycardia to code I47.1-.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-28">Cardiac Arrest (I46)</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">Cardiac arrest is the sudden stopping of the heart’s pumping function that causes arterial blood pressure to cease and produces either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular standstill. Cardiac arrest usually leads to death unless resuscitation occurs (Dorland 2023). ICD-10-CM includes three codes for cardiac arrest: I46.2, Cardiac arrest due to underlying cardiac condition; I46.8, Cardiac arrest due to other underlying condition; and I46.9, Cardiac arrest, cause unspecified. Under codes I46.2 and I46.8, there is a code first note to code the underlying <br />cardiac or other underlying condition as the first code. The specificity of the type of cardiac arrest is essential for coding; is it due to a cardiac condition or another disease or is the <br />cardiac arrest related to another medical condition or procedure.</p>

CVAs may also be referred to as a strokes or stroke syndrome. A stroke is a condition with a sudden onset of acute vascular lesions of the brain, such as an infarction from a hemorrhage or an embolism or a thrombosis. It can also be caused by a ruptured aneurysm. The condition causes neurological symptoms such as hemiparesis, vertigo, numbness, aphasia, and dysarthria that may be temporary and resolve as the patient recovers from the stroke. For other patients, these neurological deficits may be permanent (Dorland 2023). The codes specify whether the condition is a cerebral hemorrhage or infarction due to a thrombosis, embolism, or unspecified occlusion or stenosis in the cerebral vessel. The cerebral infarction codes identify the specific cerebral artery involved and laterality (right or left). Category I69, Sequelae of cerebrovascular disease, contains a lot of codes for very specific conditions that remain after the acute CVA is treated.</p>

Category I63 includes occlusion and stenosis of cerebral and precerebral arteries that result in a cerebral infarction. The default code for stroke or CVA is I63.9, Cerebral infarction, unspecified.

			<p class="Text">The ICD-10-PCS procedure code for a multiple vessel native coronary artery angiography or arteriography using low osmolar contrast material is B2111ZZ. The ICD-10-PCS procedure code for a left ventriculogram using low osmolar contrast material is B2151ZZ.</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty</p>
			<p class="Text-flush"><span class="CharOverride-1">Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)</span> is used to relieve obstruction of coronary arteries. PTCA is performed to widen a narrowed area of a coronary artery by employing a balloon-tipped catheter. The catheter is passed to the obstructed area, and the balloon is inflated one or more times to exert pressure on the narrowed area. A thrombolytic agent may be infused into the heart.</p>
			<p class="Text">A PTCA procedure may also include the insertion of one or more coronary stents. It is possible to insert stents in several different vessels during the same operative episode. It is also possible to insert multiple adjoining or overlapping stents.</p>
			<p class="Text">The objective of a PTCA is to open or dilate the coronary artery or bypass coronary graft. The root operation in ICD-10-PCS for this procedure is Dilation by definition. The main term in the ICD-10-PCS Index is Dilation with subterms artery, coronary, and then the number of vessels: one, two, three, four, or more. The Index gives the first three digits as “027.” To construct the procedure code for the PTCA, the coder accesses Table 027. If the insertion of a coronary artery stent is performed with the angioplasty, the sixth character (device) is used to identify the type of stent: Intraluminal Device, Drug Eluting or Intraluminal Device, or Nondrug Eluting. If the PTCA is performed without the insertion of a stent, there is a value of Z for no device used for the sixth character. The number of codes assigned depends on the number of vessels treated by angioplasty and the number of vessels that have a stent or device inserted. For example, if an angioplasty is performed on one coronary artery and if an angioplasty with the insertion of a stent is performed on a different coronary artery, two codes are assigned because the device value would be different for the two vessels. On the other hand, if an angioplasty is performed on two coronary arteries and neither <span id="page341" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 341"></span>has a stent inserted, there would be one procedure code assigned. Table 027 is shown in table 12.3. For example, if an angioplasty is performed on the left anterior descending and the right coronary artery without any stent insertion in either vessel, the code assigned would be 02713ZZ. However, if an angioplasty is performed on the left anterior descending and an angioplasty with a plain stent&#160;inserted in the right coronary artery, two codes would be assigned: 02703ZZ and 02703DZ.</p>

			<p class="Text ParaOverride-8">The AICD is an electronic device consisting of a pulse generator and three leads. The pulse generator is implanted under the patient’s skin, usually in the shoulder area. The first lead senses heart rate at the right ventricle; the second lead, sensing morphology and rhythm, defibrillates at the right atrium; the third lead defibrillates at the apical pericardium. The AICD can be programmed to suit each patient’s needs, and it uses far less energy than an external defibrillator.</p>

For an AICD the device value is K for Cardiac Lead, Defibrillator in ICD-10-PCS Table 02H for insertion of device in (location).
