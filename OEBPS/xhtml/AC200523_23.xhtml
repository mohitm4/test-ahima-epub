			<p class="Text">Chapter 20: External Causes of Morbidity (V00–Y99), contains codes that have the first character of V, W, X, and Y. It is helpful to review the Tabular List and read all the instructional notes to gain an understanding of the possible codes available.</p>
			<p class="Text">This chapter permits the classification of <span class="CharOverride-1">external causes</span> that are intended to provide data for injury research and evaluation of injury prevention strategies. External cause codes in Chapter 20 of ICD-10-CM capture the cause of the injury or health condition, the <span class="CharOverride-1">intent of the event</span> (accidental or incidental), the place where the event occurred, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the patient’s status (such as civilian or military). Coding external causes of injuries and other conditions provides valuable data for research and evaluation of injury prevention strategies (CDC 2023). External cause codes provide information that is extremely useful to public health agencies and may assist healthcare planners in determining the kind of accidents a particular facility or physician treats.</p>
			<p class="Text">No external cause code can be assigned as the principal, first-listed, or only listed diagnosis code. When a code from this section is applicable, it is intended that it will be used secondary to a code from another chapter of the classification indicating the nature of the condition. Most often, the condition will be classifiable to ICD-10-CM Chapter 19: Injury, Poisoning, and Certain Other Consequences of External Causes (S00–T88). Other conditions that may be stated to be due to external causes are classified in Chapters 1 to 18. For these conditions, the external cause codes from ICD-10-CM Chapter 20 should be used to provide additional information as to the cause of the condition.</p>

			<p class="Text">The use of external cause codes is optional for physicians and healthcare facilities unless there is state-based mandatory reporting. Each provider or facility must decide whether it needs the information the external cause codes provide. Today, the information about accidents and other external causes of patients’ injuries and illnesses may be of great value to hospital planning and to public health agencies. Because of the value of this information, many state governments have mandated the use of some or all of the types of external causes that can be reported. For example, some states have required the external cause of the injury and the place of occurrence. Other states have required reporting of external cause codes by certain providers, such as hospitals that are regional trauma centers. Each physician or hospital must consider the requirements of their state agencies to decide what reporting is mandated.</p>

			<p class="Text">In addition to the external cause code that identifies the event that cause the illness or injury, three other external cause codes identify other factors concerning the event. The additional facts that are available to be reported are as follows:</p>

A note under category Y92 states “The following category is for use, when relevant, to identify the place of occurrence of the external cause. Use in conjunction with an activity code. Generally, the place of occurrence should be recorded only at the initial encounter for treatment. However, in the rare instance that a new injury occurs during hospitalization, an additional place of occurrence code may be assigned” (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">The guidelines and the instructional note with category Y93, <span class="CharOverride-1">Activity codes</span>, states, “Category Y93 is provided for use to indicate the activity of the person seeking healthcare for an injury or health condition, such as a heart attack while shoveling snow, which resulted from, or was contributed to, by the activity.” The activity code should be recorded only once at the initial encounter for treatment (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="Text">The third category used to provide additional facts about the event is category Y99, <span class="CharOverride-1">External cause status.</span> The note that appears in the ICD-10-CM code book under category Y99 states “A single code from category Y99 should be used in conjunction with the external cause code(s) assigned to a record to indicate the status of the person at the time the event occurred” (CDC 2023). The external cause status code indicates the work status of the person at the time the event occurred. The external cause status code is used only once at the initial encounter for treatment.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">External cause codes are intended to provide data for injury research and evaluation of injury prevention strategies. These codes capture how the injury or health condition happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or accidental; or intentional, such as suicide or assault), the place where the event occurred, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the person’s status (e.g., civilian, military).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">There is no national requirement for mandatory ICD-10-CM external cause code reporting. Unless a provider is subject to a state-based external code reporting mandate or these codes are required by a particular payer, reporting of ICD-10-CM codes in <br />Chapter 20, External Causes of Morbidity, is not required. In the <span id="page647" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 647"></span>absence of a mandatory reporting requirement, providers are encouraged to voluntarily report external cause codes, as they provide valuable data for injury research and evaluation of injury prevention strategies.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.1. Used with any code in the range of A00.0–T88.9, <br />Z00–Z99:</span> An external cause code may be used with any code in the range of A00.0–T88.9, Z00–Z99, classification that represents a health condition due to an external cause. Though they are most applicable to injuries, they are also valid for use with such things as infections or diseases due to an external source, and other health conditions, such as a heart attack that occurs during strenuous physical activity.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.2. External cause code used for length of treatment:</span> Assign the external cause code, with the appropriate 7th character (initial encounter, subsequent encounter or sequela) for each encounter for which the injury or condition is being treated.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">Most categories in chapter 20 have a 7th character requirement for each applicable code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character values: A, initial encounter, D, subsequent encounter, and S, sequela. While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the course of treatment for an injury or condition, assignment of the 7th character for external cause should match the 7th character of the code assigned for the associated injury or condition for the encounter.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.3. Use the full range of external cause codes:</span> Use the full range of external cause codes to completely describe the cause, the intent, the place of occurrence, and if applicable, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the patient’s status, for all injuries, and other health conditions due to an external cause.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.4. Assign as many external cause codes as necessary:</span> Assign as many external cause codes as necessary to fully explain each cause. If only one external code can be recorded, assign the code most related to the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.5. The selection of the appropriate external cause code:</span> The selection of the appropriate external cause code is guided by the Alphabetic Index of External Causes and by Inclusion and Exclusion notes in the Tabular List.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.6. External cause code can never be a <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-3">principal diagnosis:</span> An external cause code can never be a principal <br />(first-listed) diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.7. Combination external cause codes:</span> Certain of the external cause codes are combination codes that identify sequential events that result in an injury, such as a fall which results in striking against an object. The injury may be due to either event or both. The combination external cause code used should correspond to the sequence of events regardless of which caused the most serious injury.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.a.8. No external cause code needed in certain circumstances:</span> No external cause code from Chapter 20 is needed if the external cause and intent are included in a code from another chapter (e.g. T36.0X1-, Poisoning by penicillins, accidental [unintentional]).</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.b. Place of Occurrence Guideline:</span> Codes from category Y92, Place of occurrence of the external cause, are secondary codes for use after other external cause codes to identify the location of the patient at the time of injury or other condition.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">Generally, a place of occurrence code is used only once, at the initial encounter for treatment. However, in the rare instance that a new injury occurs during the hospitalization, an additional place of occurrence code may be assigned. No 7th characters are used for Y92. Do not use place of occurrence code Y92.9 if the place is not stated or is not applicable.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.c. Activity Code:</span> Assign a code from category Y93, Activity code, to describe the activity of the patient at the time the injury or other health condition occurred.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">An activity code is used only once, at the initial encounter for treatment. Only one code from Y93 should be recorded on a medical record. The activity codes are not applicable to poisonings, adverse effects, misadventures or sequela.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">Do not assign Y93.9, Unspecified activity, if the activity is not stated.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9">A code from category Y93 is appropriate for use with external cause and intent codes if identifying the activity provides additional information about the event.</p>
			<p class="CG_Txt ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-3">Guideline I.C.20.d.

			<p class="_-hd">Coding External Cause of Morbidity&#160;<br />in ICD-10-CM Chapter 20</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">As stated previously, an external cause code can never be a principal, first-listed, or only diagnosis code reported. An external cause code, with the appropriate seventh character (initial encounter, subsequent encounter, or sequela), is assigned for each encounter for which the injury or condition is being treated. This includes the initial encounter and all subsequent encounters when the condition being treated was caused by an external cause. Some of these healthcare encounters can be years later when the patient continues to suffer from the consequences of the original problem that was caused by an external event.</p>
			<p class="Text">When it is applicable, an external cause code is used as an additional code with another code from other chapters in ICD-10-CM in the range of A00.0–T88.9, Z00–Z99 to identify when a health condition or injury is due to an external cause. External cause codes are used <span id="page652" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="page 652"></span>most commonly with codes for injuries. However, there may also be an external cause to be reported as the cause of other conditions such as infections or diseases, for example, when a musculoskeletal condition is produced as the result of overuse or repetitive motions.</p>
			<p class="Text">The coder may use the full range of external cause codes to completely describe the cause, the intent, the place of occurrence, and if applicable, the activity of the patient at the time of the <br />event, and the patient’s status, for all injuries, and other health conditions due to an external <br />cause. The coder may assign as many external cause codes as necessary to fully explain each cause. <br />If only one external code can be recorded, the coder should assign the code most related to the principal diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Text">The coder must recognize that no external cause code from Chapter 20 is needed if the external cause and intent are included in a code from another chapter. For example, an external cause code is not used with a code for a poisoning. The code T36.0X1, Poisoning by penicillins, accidental (unintentional), includes the intent and therefore would not require the use of an external cause code.</p>
			<p class="Text">Certain external cause codes are combination codes that identify sequential events that result in an injury, such as a fall that results in striking against an object. The injury may be due to either event or both. The combination external cause code used should correspond to the sequence of events regardless of which event caused the most serious injury.</p>
			<p class="Text">If the reporting format limits the number of external cause codes that can be used in reporting clinical data, the coder should report the code for the cause or intent most relative to the principal diagnosis. If additional external cause codes are allowed, the cause or intent, including medical misadventures, of the additional events should be reported rather than the codes for place, activity, or external status (CDC 2023).</p>
			<p class="_-hd">Seventh Character to Identify the Encounter</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">ICD-10-CM indicates when one of the external cause codes in the range of V00–Y99 codes require a seventh character to indicate whether the healthcare encounter was the</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-10">A—Initial encounter,</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-11">D—Subsequent encounter, or</p>
			<p class="Ex ParaOverride-2">S—Sequela.</p>
			<p class="Text">Because an external cause code is assigned for each encounter for which the injury or condition is being treated, the <span class="CharOverride-1">seventh character</span> identifies the timing of the care for <br /> the condition. The encounter could be the first time the patient is treated, it could be a follow-up visit or subsequent encounter, or it could be a much later encounter. When the external cause is recognized as the cause of a <span class="CharOverride-1">sequela</span>, or condition that the patient has today, and continues to receive treatment, the external cause is reported with the seventh character S for sequela. These later encounters identify when the long-term effect of an injury is being treated.</p>
			<p class="Text">Certain external causes are only used once, at the initial encounter for treatment, such as the place of occurrence codes, the activity code, and the external status code(s). The actual external cause, such as a fall or transportation accident, continues to be reported with the appropriate seventh character for as long as the patient receives treatment.</p>
			<p class="Text">The seventh character of an external cause code must always be the seventh character in the data field. If a code that requires a seventh character is not six characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters.</p>

For example, if a patient was treated during an initial encounter for two injuries from two external causes that occurred at the same time, such as a burn from hot stove (X15.0XXA) and a fracture from a fall (W18.30XA), there is only one place of occurrence code used, for example, the kitchen in a single family residence (Y92.000), only one activity code, for example, baking and cooking (Y93.G3), and only one external cause status code, for example, this was a leisure activity for the patient (Y99.8).

In addition, if the intent of an event is unknown or unspecified, that is, it is not stated to be an accident, self-harm, or an assault, the coder can assume the intent of the event is accidental. The only time the coder uses the event codes that state there is an undetermined intent is when the documentation in the record specifically states the intent of the event cannot be determined.</p>
			<p class="_-hd ParaOverride-17">Sequelae or Late Effect External Cause Codes</p>
			<p class="Text-flush">To identify that a patient’s condition being treated today is from an event that occurred in the past, the external cause code is reported with the seventh character S for sequela. These external cause codes should be used with any report of a late effect or sequela resulting from a previous injury. A sequela external cause code should never be used with a related current nature of injury code. Typically, a patient with a sequela of a past injury or illness is coded as follows (CDC 2023):</p>

			<p class="Text">Those relating to land transport accidents (V00–V89) reflect the victim’s mode of transport and are subdivided to identify the victim’s counterpart or the type of event. The vehicle of which the injured person is an occupant is identified in the first two characters since it is seen as the most important factor to identify for prevention purposes. A transport accident is one in which the vehicle involved must be moving or running or in use for transport purposes at the time of the <br />accident. The definitions of transport vehicles are provided at the beginning of Chapter 20. <br />A “use additional code” note appears under the heading for transport accidents (V00–V99) to use another code for airbag injury (W22.1-), type of street or road (Y92.4-), and use of cellular telephone or other electronic equipment at the time of the transport accident (Y93.C-).</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">ICD-10-CM contains external cause codes to identify and track the occurrence of wrong site surgery, wrong surgery, and wrong patient having surgery to support the collection of data related to the National Quality Forum’s <span class="CharOverride-1">never events</span>. The federal government’s Institute of Medicine (IOM) developed a comprehensive approach to improving patient safety in American healthcare organizations by identifying certain healthcare errors and particular events that were reported in a systemic manner. To accomplish this, the IOM worked with the National Quality Forum to identify a list of “serious reportable events” in healthcare that should never occur. This list of events has become known as “never events” as a result of the National Quality Forum’s report “Serious Reportable Events in Healthcare: A Consensus Report” (Kizer and Stegun 2005). A complete list of the never events and the work of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) can be found in table 23.1.</p>
			<p class="Text ParaOverride-20">The wrong site, wrong surgery, and wrong patient never events or serious reportable events are among the list of adverse medical events that are serious, largely preventable, and of concern to patients and healthcare providers. The Joint Commission, the federal government, and state governments use the never events list as the basis for quality indicators and <br />state-based reporting systems. The following are examples of external cause codes that can be used to describe the external cause of several of these factors:</p>

			<p class="Text-flush">When the cause of an injury is identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as terrorism, the first-listed external cause code should be a code from category Y38, Terrorism. The definition of terrorism employed by the FBI is found at the inclusion note at the beginning of category Y38. The note reads, “These codes are for use to identify injuries resulting from the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objective” (CDC 2023). Use an additional code for place of occurrence (Y92.-). More than one Y38 code may be assigned if the injury is the result of more than one mechanism of terrorism. When the cause of an injury is suspected to be the result of terrorism, a code from category Y38 should not be assigned. Suspected cases should be classified as assault. Assign code Y38.9, Terrorism, secondary effects, for conditions occurring subsequent to the terrorist event. This code should not be assigned for conditions that are due to the initial terrorist act. It is acceptable to assign code Y38.9 with another code from Y38 if there is an injury due to the initial terrorist event and an injury that is a subsequent result of the terrorist event. The main term to be used in the External Cause of Injuries Index would be “terrorism.”</p>

An activity code should be used in conjunction with a place of occurrence code, Y92. <br />The activity codes are not applicable to poisonings, adverse effects, misadventures, or sequela.

			<p class="Text">A code from category Y93 is appropriate for use with external cause and intent codes if identifying the activity provides additional information about the event. A note at the beginning of category Y93 in the Tabular states the activity code is provided to indicate <br />the activity of the person seeking healthcare for an injury or health condition that resulted <br />from the activity or was contributed to by the activity, such as a heart attack while shoveling snow. These codes are appropriate for use for both acute injuries, such as those from Chapter 19 <br />and conditions that are due to the long-term, cumulative effects of an activity, such as those from Chapter 13. They are also appropriate for use with external cause codes for cause and intent if identifying the activity provides additional information on the event. These codes should be used in conjunction with codes for external cause status (Y99) and place of occurrence (Y92). The activity code is used only once, at the initial encounter for treatment.
